1
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,430
Thank you, Alice.
You've been a big help.

2
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,830
I wish I could have tea
with everyone.

3
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,330
I really wish I could.

4
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,230
Tea is for grownups,
dear.

5
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,630
But, Mother,
when will I be grown up?

6
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,230
Oh, be patient, Alice.

7
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,000
Teatime for you
will come soon enough.

8
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,860
Now, why don't you
go outside and keep
your sister company?

9
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,060
Yes, Mother.
Okay.

10
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,200
You know,
I really do wish
you'd tell me,

11
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,330
just what good is a book
without any pictures?

12
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,360
It looks so dull.
I mean, it really does.

13
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,800
You'll understand soon enough,
when you grow up.

14
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,160
Look, I'm already
seven and a half.

15
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,700
I think
that's quite grown up.

16
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,300
And I really do wish
you'd stop talking to me
as though I was a child.

17
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,600
But you are
still a child, Alice.

18
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,230
You can't really think
that you're a grownup.

19
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,960
Yes, I do. Almost.

20
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,760
I mean, just how on Earth
am I supposed to know
when I'm grown up or not?

21
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,960
Would you mind
telling me that?

22
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,460
There are a lot of ways
to know that.

23
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, then tell me.
At least a hint.

24
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,700
Well, for one thing,
you have to be much taller
to be grown up.

25
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,430
And you won't cry as much.

26
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,400
You are a bit
of a crybaby.

27
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,360
I am not.

28
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,100
I don't cry much at all.
Hardly ever.

29
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, when you've grown up,
you'll cry much less
than you do now.

30
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
And one of the best ways
to know if you've grown up

31
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,030
is when Mother asks you
to join the rest
of the grownups for tea.

32
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Dinah, dear,
you think I'm grown up,
don't you?

33
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I shall be too late.

34
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,960
Mr. Rabbit!
Mr. Rabbit!

35
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,700
Mr. Rabbit!

36
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Oh, my ears and whiskers,
how late it's getting!

37
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,000
Mr. Rabbit!
Mr. Rabbit!

38
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,100
Wait! Wait!

39
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,100
That's strange.

40
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,130
I wonder how many there are.

41
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,660
How am I ever
gonna get home?

42
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,730
I can't imagine
who could fit through there.

43
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,800
Unless it was for a mouse.

44
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,700
This must fit
that little door.

45
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,030
Oh, how beautiful.

46
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,600
This must surely
be the way home.

47
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,530
I can't get through.

48
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,300
It's all very well
to say, "Drink Me."

49
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,860
I'll look first and see
whether it's marked poison
or not.

50
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,600
Mmm.

51
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh.

52
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,430
Oh, I... I feel so strange.

53
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,860
Oh, my.

54
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh.

55
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,730
What's happening to me?
I'm shrinking!

56
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm so small.

57
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,100
So very small.

58
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,900
But now, at least,
I'm the right size

59
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,030
for going through
the little door.

60
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,900
Oh, how stupid!
How really stupid!

61
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,160
I've forgotten the key
way up on top of that table.

62
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,060
Come on now, Alice,
there's no use
starting to cry.

63
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,130
Stop it this moment.
Stop! Stop! Stop!

64
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,900
Now, what's this?

65
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
"Eat me."

66
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,960
That's certainly
a strange thing
to write on a cake.

67
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,960
But I will eat it.

68
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,130
Perhaps it'll make me
grow bigger.

69
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,330
And If it makes me
grow bigger,

70
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,360
then I can reach the key.

71
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,430
But if it makes me
grow a little smaller,

72
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,260
then I can creep
under the door.

73
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,800
Bigger or smaller?

74
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,400
Which way?

75
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,630
Oh, I think
I'm staying the same size.

76
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,630
Oh.

77
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Oh, something is happening.

78
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,260
Curiouser and curiouser.

79
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Ooh.

80
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,660
Now I'm opening up
like a telescope.

81
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,900
Ooh. Goodbye, feet!

82
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm so big, now I'll never
get through that little door.

83
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,060
I wanna go home.

84
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,400
I wanna go home.

85
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,360
I wanna go home.

86
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,430
Oh, the Duchess,
the Duchess!

87
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,130
Won't she be savage
if I kept her waiting?

88
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,430
If you please, sir.
Sir, Rabbit!

89
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,230
What's happening now?

90
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Ooh.

91
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,000
It's the fan
that's making me shrink!

92
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,260
Oh, that was a narrow escape.

93
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,760
Oh, now I've fallen
into the sea.

94
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,760
But this isn't the sea.

95
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,860
These are my tears
when I was nine feet tall!

96
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,630
Oh, I wish
I hadn't cried so much.

97
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,500
I should be
punished for it now,

98
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,900
for being drowned
in my own tears.

99
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,630
Won't that be a queer thing?

100
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,360
However, everything's
been queer today.

101
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,500
What is that?

102
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,830
It must be a walrus
or a hippopotamus!

103
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
For goodness' sake,
stop crying.

104
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,260
Stop crying!
Don't cry anymore!

105
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,230
Sir?

106
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,400
Me?

107
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,400
Do you know
the way out of here?

108
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,430
I'm a stranger here myself.

109
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,900
Mouse, do you know
the way out?

110
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,760
Mouse, don't you
understand English?

111
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,830
What?

112
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,900
Are you French?

113
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,400
That means, "Where's my cat?"
You know.

114
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,060
Oh, I beg your pardon.

115
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,300
I quite forgot
you don't like cats.

116
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,200
Our family has
always hated cats.

117
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,600
Nasty, low, vulgar things.

118
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,530
Don't ever let me
hear that name again!

119
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,330
I won't. I promise.

120
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,060
Are you afraid of dogs?

121
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,060
There's a nice old terrier
who kills all the rats.

122
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,160
Oh! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

123
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,430
I won't mention
those creatures again!

124
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
All right. Come on.

125
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,560
Let's go to shore
and I'll tell you
why I hate cats and dogs.

126
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,660
That's a very good idea.

127
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,730
Excellent, Sir Mouse.

128
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,760
# I hate dogs
and I hate cats #

129
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,930
# I'm also not
too fond of bats #

130
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,160
# I'm a helpless
little fellow #

131
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,830
# Consequently
rather yellow #

132
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,930
# Now, you may think
that dogs are sweet #

133
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,300
# Since they love to
snuggle at your feet #

134
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,530
# But to me
they're oh, so large #

135
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,760
# That I tremble
when they charge #

136
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,930
# Now, certain words
like "big" and "small" #

137
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,660
# Mean what?

138
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,360
# Would you
please tell me? #

139
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,630
# To me all cats
are 10 feet tall #

140
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,300
# So I worry
when they smell me #

141
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,060
# I run from owls
I hide from hawks #

142
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,260
# I scurry from
whatever squawks #

143
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,760
# I'm a coward

144
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,700
# From my whiskers
to my spats #

145
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,560
# I hate dogs
and cats! #

146
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,260
# Now, certain words
like "big" and "small" #

147
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,460
# Mean what?

148
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,830
# Would you
please tell me? #

149
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,960
# To me all cats
are 10 feet tall #

150
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,600
# So I worry
when they smell me #

151
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,560
# I run from owls
I hide from hawks #

152
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,630
# I scurry from
whatever squawks #

153
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,330
# I'm a coward

154
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,360
# From my whiskers
to my spats! #

155
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,600
# But I tell you straight

156
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,530
# That I really hate

157
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,830
# Owls, dogs, hawks, bats!

158
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,830
# I hate dogs and cats! #

159
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,830
Hey,
what are you running for?

160
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,160
Wait a minute.

161
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,860
Just what is
going on around here?

162
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,000
Are you all crazy?

163
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,100
Won't anybody answer me?

164
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,230
Now, wait a minute! Hey!

165
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,330
Now I know what it means
to act like animals!

166
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Somebody should
teach you all proper manners.

167
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,660
The Duchess!

168
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,500
The Duchess!
Oh, my dear paws!

169
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,960
Oh, my fur
and whiskers.

170
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,300
She'll have me executed

171
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,260
as sure as ferrets
are ferrets.

172
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,530
And where on Earth
did I drop my fan
and gloves?

173
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,160
I know, Mr. Rabbit.

174
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,300
I had them,
but I seem to have
lost them.

175
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,100
Mary Ann, what are you
doing out here?

176
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,760
You go home this moment
and... and fetch me a pair
of gloves and fan.

177
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,530
Quick now, Mary Ann!

178
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,260
He mistook me
for his housemaid.

179
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,330
How surprised he'll be
when he finds out
who I am really.

180
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,860
But I'd better find
his fan and gloves

181
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,060
and bring them
back to him if I can.

182
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,630
It seems so silly
to be running errands
for a rabbit.

183
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,960
I suppose Dinah will be
giving me orders next.

184
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,400
Like, "Alice,
come here directly

185
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,900
and watch this mouse hole
until I get back."

186
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,700
There's the fan and gloves.

187
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,030
I know something interesting
is sure to happen

188
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,230
whenever I eat
or drink anything.

189
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,630
So I'll just see
what this bottle does.

190
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,800
Now, that's quite enough.

191
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,560
I hope I won't grow
any more.

192
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,900
As it is,
I'm sure I won't be able
to get through the door.

193
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,200
I wish I hadn't
drunk so much.

194
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,360
Mary Ann! Mary Ann!

195
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,060
Fetch me my gloves
this moment!

196
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,430
Pat! Pat!
Where are you?

197
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,730
Back here
digging for apples,
Your Honor.

198
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,930
Digging for apples,
indeed!

199
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,730
Come and get me
out of here!

200
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,800
Your Honor,
what happened? Here.

201
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,000
Pat! Pat!
Wha-What's that in the window?

202
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,730
I-I-I-It's an arm,
Your Honor.
An arm?

203
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
You goose!

204
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,330
Did you ever see
an arm that size?

205
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
It fills the whole window.

206
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,700
It sure does, Your Honor,
but... but it's an arm anyway.

207
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,960
Yeah, well,
at any rate,
it has no business there.

208
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,700
You... You go
and take it away.

209
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,630
Oh, I don't like this at all,
Your Honor.
I... I don't like it at all.

210
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,230
Bill! Bill!
Come out here and help!

211
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,100
And bring the ladder!
Quick, Bill!

212
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,500
I got it.

213
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,200
Hurry up!

214
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
I got it.

215
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,300
What are you doing?
Come on, bring it here.

216
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,960
Here,
tell him what to do.

217
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,430
Get up on the roof.

218
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,700
Oh, my goodness.

219
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,930
Hurry, Bill.

220
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,100
Do you think
the roof will hold him?
I hope so!

221
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,200
Bill!

222
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,160
Oh, my goodness.

223
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,200
Bill!
Bill, go down the chimney!

224
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,860
That's a good idea,
Your Honor.
Down the chimney, Billy!

225
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,200
Down the chimney!

226
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,000
Bill's got to go down
the chimney, does he?

227
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,430
I think I can
take care of that.

228
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,000
Watch your step, Bill!

229
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,600
Down the chimney, Bill.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

230
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,160
That's for Bill.

231
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,100
There goes Bill.

232
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,430
Goodbye, Bill!

233
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,700
I wonder what
they're gonna do next.

234
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,560
You'd better
not do that again.

235
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,500
They're such little cakes.

236
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,600
If I eat one,
they're sure to make
some change in my size.

237
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,160
And since it can't possibly
make me grow larger.

238
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,900
Mary Ann!
Mary Ann! Come back here!

239
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Come back here,
Mary Ann! You hear me?

240
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,360
Come back here!

241
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,060
Mary Ann! Stop running!
Come back!

242
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,330
Who are you?

243
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,560
I hardly know, sir.

244
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,900
I knew who I was
when I got up this morning,

245
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,400
but I keep changing sizes.

246
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,330
And I'm afraid
I'll never find
my way home again.

247
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,360
Explain yourself.

248
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,260
I can't, sir.
Because I'm not myself,
you see?

249
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,560
No, I don't see.

250
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,560
Well, being so many sizes
in one day

251
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,060
is very confusing
to a little girl.

252
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,230
No, it isn't.

253
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,760
Well, perhaps
you haven't found it so yet.

254
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,530
But when you have to
turn into a chrysalis

255
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,400
and then a butterfly,
you'll feel a little bit queer
then, won't you?

256
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,000
Not a bit.

257
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,630
Well, it would feel
very queer to me.

258
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,630
You? Who are you?

259
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,860
Well, I think
you ought to tell me
who you are first.

260
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,230
Why?

261
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,030
Well, I don't know exactly.

262
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,360
Besides, I think
you're very rude.
Goodbye!

263
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,000
Wait! Wait!

264
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,800
I've got something
very important to say to you.

265
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,900
What?

266
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,200
Keep your temper.

267
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,400
Is that all
you have to say to me?

268
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,800
Well, no.

269
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,830
I was also curious
about your earlier remark.

270
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,560
So you think
you've changed, do you?

271
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,900
I definitely have.

272
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,430
In fact,
I think I've actually
grown up quite a bit.

273
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,360
But I can't quite remember.

274
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,730
Why not?

275
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,360
Well, there are
a lot of things.

276
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,700
Oh, like
when I tried to recite
one of my favorite poems,

277
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,330
it came out all wrong.

278
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,560
Well, try You Are Old,
Father William,

279
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,700
and see
how that comes out.

280
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,000
Do you know that poem?

281
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,760
Of course.

282
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,560
Let me see. It starts...

283
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,630
"You...

284
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,060
"You..."
Wait, let me help you.

285
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,300
# "You are old,
Father William,"
the young man said #

286
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,000
# "And your hair
has become very white #

287
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,730
# "And yet you incessantly
stand on your head #

288
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,160
# "Do you think,
at your age, it is right?" #

289
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,430
# "In my youth,"
Father William
replied to his son #

290
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,060
# "I feared
it might injure the brain #

291
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,730
# "But now that
I'm perfectly sure
I have none #

292
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,600
# "Why, I do it again
and again" #

293
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,460
# "You are old,"
said the youth #

294
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,900
# "As I mentioned before,
and have grown
most uncommonly fat #

295
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,830
# "Yet you turned
a back-somersault
in at the door #

296
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,460
# "Pray,
what is the reason
for that?" #

297
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,300
# "You are old,"
said the youth #

298
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,630
# "And your jaws are too weak
for anything
tougher than suet #

299
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,630
# "Yet you finished the goose
with the bones and the beak #

300
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,000
# "Pray,
how did you manage
to do it?" #

301
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,230
# "You are old,"
said the youth #

302
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,830
# "One would hardly suppose
that your eye
was as steady as ever #

303
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,000
# "Yet you balanced
an eel on the end
of your nose #

304
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,460
# "What made you
so awfully clever?" #

305
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,000
# "You have asked me
three questions
Now, that is enough" #

306
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,600
# Said his father,
"Don't give yourself airs! #

307
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,460
# "Do you think I can listen
all day to such stuff? #

308
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,060
# "Be off, boy!

309
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,060
# "Or I'll kick you
downstairs #

310
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,430

downstairs #

311
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,130
# "Or I'll kick you
downstairs #

312
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,060
# "Or I'll kick you

313
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,960
# "Or I'll kick you
downstairs" #

314
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,560
That was excellent.

315
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,900
Now, what size do you
want to be, little girl?

316
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,160
Well, I should like to be
a little larger, sir.

317
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,800
This is such
a wretched height to be,
you know.

318
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,460
Oh? It happens to be
a very good height indeed,

319
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,160
since it also happens
to be exactly my height.

320
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,760
I'm terribly sorry.

321
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,860
I didn't mean it
as an insult.

322
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,800
Mr. Caterpillar,
where are you?

323
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,030
Why, he's disappeared.

324
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,300
He just
absolutely disappeared.

325
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,600
Surely someone here
can tell me
the way to go home.

326
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,500
It's for the Duchess.

327
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,760
It's an invitation
from the Queen
to play croquet.

328
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,800
There's no use in ringing,

329
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,300
because I'm on the same side
of the gate as you are.

330
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,530
Then how am I
supposed to get in?

331
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Well, I don't know
about you,

332
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,730
but as for me,
I'm going to sit here
until tomorrow

333
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,500
or the next day, maybe.

334
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,830
Well, I'm not.

335
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,530
Oh, there's certainly
too much pepper in that soup.

336
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,960
Not in my soup.

337
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,530
Oh, no.

338
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,830
Will you please be careful?

339
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,700
If everybody minded
their own business,

340
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,360
this world would go around
a lot faster than it does.

341
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,460
Which would not
be an advantage,
if you ask me.

342
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:50,130
I mean, you see,
the Earth takes 24 hours
to turn around its axis.

343
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Speaking of axes,
chop off her nose.

344
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,900
You are acting
very hateful to that baby.

345
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,130
Am I?

346
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,600
Well, my dear.

347
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,900
# There's something
to say for hatred #

348
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,530
# For rudeness
and for spite #

349
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,830
# Oh, no, my friend,
we can't pretend #

350
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,800
# That everything's
sweetness and light #

351
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,760
# There's something
to say for trouble #

352
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,800
# For nastiness
and gloom #

353
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,360
# Just try to be cheerful

354
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,960
# And you'll get an earful
of your impending doom #

355
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,830
# This world
is not a paradise #

356
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,360
# lf, indeed, ooh, ooh,
it ever was #

357
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,200
# It's a vale of tears
and so, my dears #

358
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,860
# Throw out the chaff?
Don't make me laugh #

359
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,830
# There's something
to say for misery #

360
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,160
# For suffering
and pain #

361
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,030
# Down at the bank,
now, let's be frank #

362
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,460
# They only care for gain

363
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,230
# There's something to say
for frowning #

364
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,330
# Why must we always smile?

365
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,260
# Forget all your dreams,
resort to schemes #

366
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,360
# And in just a little while

367
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,460
# The best-laid plans
of mice and men #

368
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,230
# Will all come
crashing down again #

369
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,900
# And we'll all
despise each other #

370
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,860
# In the grandest style #

371
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,230
Is the baby all right?

372
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
You wanna hold him
for a while?

373
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,530
Here.

374
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,000
I have to get ready.
I'm playing croquet
with the Queen.

375
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,630
If I don't take
this baby away with me,
they're sure to kill it.

376
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Now, look, little baby,
if you're going
to turn into a pig,

377
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,960
then I'll have nothing more
to do with you.

378
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,800
Oh, well,
if it had grown up,

379
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,660
it would have made
a dreadfully ugly child.

380
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,500
But maybe
a rather handsome pig,
I suppose.

381
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,660
Excuse me, Cheshire Cat.

382
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,230
Would you tell me please
which way I ought
to go from here?

383
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,100
That depends a good deal
on where you wanna get to.

384
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,800
Home.

385
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,700
I need to get home.

386
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,760
I know my mother's
already begun to miss me.

387
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,600
Oh, and my cat, Dinah,
must be very hungry.

388
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,030
Home?

389
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,100
Home, is it?

390
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,460
Well, you listen closely,
little girl.

391
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,860
# There's no way home

392
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,660
# from this strange land

393
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:56,830
# Don't even try
to understand #

394
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,260
# You're lost in time

395
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,800
# without a trace

396
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:09,630
# Resign yourself
to your disgrace #

397
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,530
# Somehow you've strayed

398
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,060
# and lost your way

399
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,860
# And now there'll be

400
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,560
# No time to play

401
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,800
# No time for joy

402
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,600
# No time for friends

403
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,030
# Not even time

404
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,860
# to make amends

405
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,730
# You are too naive

406
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,260
# if you do believe

407
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:47,430
# Life is innocent laughter
and fun #

408
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,100
# There are things to fear

409
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,730
# So you see, my dear

410
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,160
# Your adventures

411
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,430
# have only begun

412
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,230
# The world's immense

413
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,430
# but sad to say

414
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,900
# It makes no sense

415
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,660
# in any way

416
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,900
# So what care I

417
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,430
# if you should cry?

418
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,930
# There's no way

419
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,430
# home #

420
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,860
I think you're a mean,
old cat.

421
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,530
There must be a way home
and I'll find it!

422
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,100
Where are you going?

423
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,500
That way.

424
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,960
Maybe I'll meet someone
kind enough to help me.

425
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,600
Oh.

426
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,300
Well, in that direction,
there's a Hatter,

427
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,700
and in that direction,
there's a March Hare.

428
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,060
Visit either you like.
They're both mad.

429
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,230
But I don't wanna
visit mad people.

430
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,660
Well, you can't help that.
We're all mad here.

431
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,260
I mean, I'm mad.
You're mad. We're all mad.

432
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,430
Meow, baby.

433
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,230
Well, a head without a cat

434
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,000
is the most curious thing
I've ever seen

435
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,260
in my whole life.

436
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,330
Oh, goody, I'm just in time
for a tea party.

437
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,800
May I introduce myself?

438
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,930
No, you may not.

439
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,330
But aren't introductions
proper at a tea party?

440
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,830
My dear child,
if you want an introduction,

441
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,660
go and get yourself
an orchestra.

442
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,030
They'll give you a good
four-bar introduction.

443
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,830
Or probably
an eight-bar introduction.

444
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,230
I just wanted to
give you my name.

445
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,930
Why, have you
finished with it?

446
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,060
Did you hear that,
Mr. Hare?

447
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,460
She wants to
give us her name.

448
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,630
That is ridiculous.
Awfully.

449
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,030
We already
have names.

450
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,530
We certainly
don't need hers.
Yes.

451
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,800
May I sit down?

452
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,800
No room! No room!
No room!

453
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,960
No room! No room!
There's plenty of room!

454
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,700
There are at least
nine empty chairs.

455
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,630
Of course there are.

456
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,500
We didn't say
there aren't any chairs.

457
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,000
We said
there wasn't any room.

458
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,760
Yeah, and there
certainly isn't, you know.

459
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,430
We are here
in the great outdoors.
Of course!

460
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,300
And there are certainly
no rooms here.

461
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,130
Right.
There are a few
in the house.

462
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,430
Would you like some wine?

463
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
I don't think
I should drink wine.

464
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,860
I'm too young.

465
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,200
Good. There isn't
any anyway.

466
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,300
Then it wasn't
very nice of you to offer it.

467
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,830
And it wasn't
very nice of you

468
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,260
to sit down
without being invited!

469
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,460
I didn't know
it was your table!

470
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:17,200
It's set for more than three.

471
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,560
You know,
your hair wants cutting.

472
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,730
You should learn
not to make personal remarks.

473
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,100
It's very rude.

474
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,800
Ooh.
Ooh.

475
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,030
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

476
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,330
I give up. Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

477
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,430
I haven't
the vaguest idea.

478
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,660
Then why did you
ask the question?

479
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:45,860
Because I was hoping
for an intelligent answer!

480
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,600
If I'd known the answer,
I wouldn't have
asked the question, would I?

481
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,130
Oh, you're hopeless.

482
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,230
Incidentally, how did you
become a March Hare?

483
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,730
Well, actually,
I started out
being a January Hare,

484
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,260
and then I worked
my way up.

485
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,200
No, I didn't mean that.

486
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,230
Well, then you should say
what you mean!

487
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,830
Quite!

488
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,030
I do.
At least, I mean what I say
and that's the same thing.

489
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,330
It isn't
the same thing at all.

490
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,830
I mean,
you might just as well say
"I see what I eat,"

491
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,430
is the same as
"I, I eat what I see."

492
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,900
I give up.

493
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,400
Fresh cup. Move down.

494
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,000
Whoop-de-doo.

495
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,000
Who's the stuffed animal?

496
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,630
I am not
a stuffed animal.
Really?

497
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,300
Not since dinner
last night.

498
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,900
I am a dormouse.

499
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,960
What do you mean,
"door mouse"?

500
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,000
You look like
a plain mouse to me.

501
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,930
And you look like
a plain little girl to me.

502
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,060
And if you think
that there's only
one kind of a mouse,

503
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,400
you have another
"think" coming.
Quite!

504
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,830
Do you wanna
take it right now?

505
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,460
Take what right now?

506
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,400
Your other "think."
You have one coming,
you know.

507
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,800
No, I... I'm not
a church mouse...
No.

508
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,460
...because I'm
too wealthy.
Of course!

509
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,430
I'm not a field mouse,
and I'm not a...
Well, I'm...

510
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,260
By the way,
what time is it?

511
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:15,430
Time? Time?
The time now is,
let me see.

512
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,760
The time is precisely 7:27.

513
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,030
That can't possibly
be right.

514
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,830
It seems to me it was 7:27
about two hours ago.

515
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,930
Young lady,
are you contradicting me?

516
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,730
I am known
as a stickler for accuracy.

517
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
A stickler? You are?

518
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,500
Yes, a stickler.

519
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,530
When people round here
want accuracy,

520
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,360
they call me in
and I stickle.

521
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,000
That's what sticklers
are supposed to do,
isn't that right?

522
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,260
But are you sure
your watch is running?

523
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,530
Oh, of course
it isn't running.

524
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,600
It's sitting here
quite quietly in my hand.

525
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,430
Besides, it could hardly run,
it has no moving parts.

526
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,930
No moving parts?

527
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,330
Correct.

528
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,430
But it's absolutely
correct twice a day.

529
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,900
Enough of this folderol!
Enough of this persiflage.

530
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
Enough of this badinage.

531
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,530
Enough of this
tomfoolery.

532
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,900
Enough of this banter.
Enough of this
saying "enough."

533
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,830
Oh, every tea party
should have a little music.

534
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,230
Of course.
Young lady,

535
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,730
would you like
to sing with us?

536
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,030
That might be very nice.

537
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,830
But what shall we sing?

538
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,500
Do you know
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star?

539
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,400
Yes, I do.

540
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,830
# Twinkle, twinkle,
little star #

541
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,760
# How I wonder
what you are #

542
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,560
No, no, no, no.
That won't do at all.

543
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,500
I prefer,
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat,
how I wonder what you're at."

544
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,700
How about,

545
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,660
# Twinkle, twinkle,
little skunk #

546
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,400
# How I wonder
if you're drunk #

547
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,200
"Twinkle, twinkle,
little ants.

548
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,100
"You do look strange
without your pants."

549
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,130
I must admit,
you three do make me laugh.

550
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,330
Now, that's a very good idea
for a song.

551
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,000
# Laugh at every
single thing we do #

552
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,860
# Just laugh

553
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:19,030
# And we shall all
perform for you #

554
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:24,560
# Just smile
and tensions will unwind #

555
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,600
# And you'll find
that your mind #

556
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,030
# Takes a kinder view

557
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,000
# Laugh

558
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:41,460
# yes, even when your skies
are gray #

559
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,830
# Just laugh

560
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,960
# And troubles
seem to float away #

561
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:54,600
# You'll find
it's very true, my dears #

562
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,360
# Through the years
that your tears #

563
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:02,860
# And your fears will fly

564
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,560
# Oh, there are times
when crying #

565
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,560
# Seems the thing to do

566
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,930
# But keep on trying

567
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,130
# Till your dreams
come true #

568
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,930
# Your heart

569
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,100
# I'm sure knows
what is best for you #

570
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,460
# So laugh, little girl

571
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,960
# Just laugh #

572
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,060
Such a lovely song.

573
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,630
Thank you,
I, I wrote it myself.

574
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,430
Now, how would you
like to tell us a story?

575
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,430
I'm afraid
I don't know one.

576
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,260
Then the Dormouse shall.

577
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,900
The Dormouse will.
Wake up!

578
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,330
Come on!
Come on. Come along.

579
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,960
Wake up!
La, la, la, wake up!

580
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,560
You've got to tell a story!
Wake up!

581
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,900
Tell a story.
Dormouse!

582
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,900
You're going to tell
a story for the little...

583
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,560
Wake up. Dormouse,
we want to hear a story.
You're going to love it.

584
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,860
Come on.
Time to wake up now.

585
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,000
Come on. Wake up.

586
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,300
Wake up. Come on, now.
Tell us a story!

587
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,030
Time to make a story.
Story.
Going to tell a story.

588
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,930
We need to tell a story.
Wake up.

589
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,430
Stop it! Stop it!

590
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,730
It doesn't matter
if anyone tells us
a story or not.

591
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,460
Well, that just shows you
how much you know. Hmm.

592
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,700
Yeah. At teatime,
everyone should tell a story.

593
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,030
Well, now that he is awake,
a story would be nice.

594
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,000
Once upon a time, there were
three little sisters

595
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,500
named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie
and they lived
at the bottom of a well.

596
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,100
But what did they live on?

597
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,600
They lived on treacle.
Molasses to you.

598
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,130
But why did they live
at the bottom of a well?

599
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,860
It was a treacle well.

600
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,660
There's no such thing.

601
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,660
Oh. Oh!

602
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,560
If you can't
keep a civil tongue,

603
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,060
why don't you finish
the story yourself?

604
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,400
No, please, go on.

605
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,600
Well,
these three little sisters,

606
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,560
they were learning
how to draw, you know.

607
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,930
And what did they draw?

608
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,230
Treacle!

609
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,760
I want a fresh cup.
Move down the table!

610
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,060
Here we go round
the table!

611
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,030
Here we go round
the table!

612
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,600
Here we go round
the table!

613
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,130
But I don't understand.

614
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,160
Where did they
draw the treacle from?

615
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,660
Well, if you can get water
from a water well,

616
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,330
I suppose you can get treacle
from a treacle well,
eh, stupid?

617
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,700
Hello, little fawn.

618
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,800
Don't be afraid,
I won't hurt you.

619
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,930
I'm so happy to find you.

620
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,130
You're the only normal person
I've met here.

621
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,330
# Why do people act
as if they're crazy? #

622
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,500
# Why do they behave
the way they do? #

623
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,930
# Don't they understand

624
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,460
# that the things
I've planned #

625
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,230
# Are dreams
that I demand #

626
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,260
# come true?

627
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,830
# Why can't they be kind

628
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,130
# to one another

629
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,700
# And see the beauty of

630
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,500
# the golden rule?

631
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,500
# Will there come a spring

632
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,460
# when we'll know
how to sing #

633
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:41,230
# that there are
better things to do? #

634
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,130
# Will there come a day

635
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,530
# we'll all know
how to say #

636
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,530
# I love you?

637
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,330
# I love

638
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,160
# you #

639
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:17,660
I wish I didn't have to go,
but I really must,

640
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,160
so you can find your mother
and I can find mine.

641
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,760
That's very curious.

642
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,530
However,
everything's curious today.

643
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,130
Excuse me, sirs.

644
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,330
But would you
tell me, please,

645
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,330
why you're painting
those roses?

646
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,860
Why, the fact is...

647
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,630
You see, miss,
this here ought to have
been a red rose bush,

648
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,400
and we put a white one in
by mistake.

649
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,460
Yes, and if the Queen
was to find out,

650
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,160
she'd cut our heads off,
you know.

651
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,630
The Queen! The Queen!

652
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,300
Here comes the Queen!

653
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,660
Who is this?
Who is what?

654
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,860
Oh!

655
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,060
Her. I don't know.

656
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,000
Idiot.

657
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,400
What is your name, child?

658
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:46,030
My name is Alice,
may it please Your Majesty.

659
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,860
We'll see about that.

660
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,600
And who are these creatures?

661
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,360
How should I know?
It's no business of mine.

662
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,160
Off with her head.

663
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,330
Oh, come now, now, dear,
be calm...

664
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,930
Did you hear me?
Off with her head!

665
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,460
Nonsense!

666
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,700
Nonsense?

667
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,900
Just for that,
off with her head
in small increments.

668
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,500
Oh, no, no.
Come now, dear.
She's only a child.

669
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,830
Did you think I was
under the impression

670
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,430
she was an alligator
or a rutabaga?

671
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,800
Of course she's a child,
and a remarkably rude one.

672
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,000
And if there's one thing
I cannot stand,

673
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,400
it's insubordination
and impertinence.

674
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,830
That's two things,
Your Majesty.

675
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,660
What? Laughing
at such effrontery!

676
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,030
You stop it.
Stop it right now!

677
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,860
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!

678
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,430
Oh, off with their heads, too!

679
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,230
My dear, you must not
excite yourself, really.

680
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,700
# When there are people
who annoy you #

681
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,130
# Or seem determined
to destroy you #

682
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,200
# There's just one thing
that must be done #

683
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,630
# Off with their heads!

684
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,730
Oh, that's rather drastic,
isn't it, dear?

685
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,360
# When there are people
who deceive you #

686
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,960
# Or have the nerve
to not believe you #

687
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,760
# There's one response
that's rather fun #

688
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,460
# Off with their heads!

689
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,500
What about
the population?

690
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,600
# Firm

691
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,530
# You must be absolutely firm
when required #

692
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,760
I'm always firm,
dear, always.

693
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,860
# Squirm

694
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,860
# That's what they'll do
when they perceive
they've been fired #

695
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,160
# Or worse

696
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:25,830
# Never mind negotiation

697
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,400
# You will find
to rule your nation #

698
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,100
# All you need
to keep your slaves
under their beds #

699
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,400
# Is just to flounce about
and shout #

700
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,800
# Off with their heads!

701
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,330
You make it all
sound so simple.

702
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,330
It is simple, my dear.
They're all simple-minded.

703
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,960
Off with their heads.

704
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,000
# Firm

705
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,260
Yes, of course, dear.

706
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,800
# You must be absolutely firm
when required #

707
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,400
I'm going to try
to be firm about it.

708
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,930
Yes, darling.

709
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,630
# Squirm

710
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,360
# That's what they'll do
when they perceive
they've been fired #

711
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,430
Don't you...

712
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,560
# Or worse

713
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:17,030
# Never mind negotiation

714
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,700
# You will find
to rule your nation #

715
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,230
# All you need
to keep your slaves
under their beds #

716
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:31,030
# Is just to flounce about
and shout #

717
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,200
# Off with their heads! #

718
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,500
I suppose you're right,
as usual.

719
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,330
I am always right,
my dear.

720
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,460
It is simply...

721
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,100
Didn't I tell you this morning
that heads would roll?

722
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,560
Yes, indeed,
you did, dear.

723
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,300
But, you know,
it's an extraordinary thing.

724
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,530
Heads do not roll
as they used to.

725
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,860
Nowadays,
they just clump down
on the ground and stay there.

726
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,100
Ah!

727
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,130
There's that
impertinent child.

728
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,760
Alice, would you
come here a minute, dear?

729
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,860
Can you play croquet?

730
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,960
Why, yes, Your Majesty.

731
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,130
Although,
I shouldn't be able to
if I had no head.

732
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,500
If you think
such conditions are going
to make me change my mind,

733
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,730
you are quite mistaken.

734
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,760
Your head is as good as gone.

735
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:25,060
But since you still have it,
we might as well put it
to some sensible use.

736
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:28,100
Come along to the game.
Oh, yes.

737
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:43,100
It's a...
It's a very fine day.

738
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,230
The Queen seems
to be enjoying it.

739
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,300
She loves
to chop off heads.

740
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,260
Oh, well, the Queen
is very excitable.

741
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,530
She even ordered
the execution

742
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,730
of a very dear friend,
the Duchess.

743
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,900
What for?

744
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,230
Did you say,
"What a pity?"

745
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,360
No, I didn't.
I said, "What for?"

746
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,500
Oh, it was
a dreadful offense.

747
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,200
She boxed
the Queen's ears.

748
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,830
Oh, don't. Do be quiet.

749
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
The Queen will hear you.

750
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,130
See, what happened, you see,
was that the Duchess
came rather late

751
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,830
and the Queen
said to her...

752
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,030
What is that?

753
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,730
Who is doing all that
gibbering and jabbering
back there?

754
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,560
Oh. Oh, dear.

755
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,030
Meaning no disrespect,
Your Majesty.

756
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,500
"Gibbering and jabbering,"
you say?

757
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,330
Well, I... I... I was gibbering
and the... and the young lady
was jabbering.

758
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,860
Well, stop it!

759
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,960
And take your places,
all of you,
for a game of croquet.

760
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,360
Well, tell me, Alice,
my dear,

761
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:57,660
are you a skillful
croquet player?

762
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:03,060
Well, I do beat my sister,
at least sometimes.

763
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,660
Who's the best player here?

764
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,730
I really don't know.

765
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,000
Her Majesty
always manages to win.

766
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,700
And if anyone
ever gets close,
it's always the same thing.

767
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,830
"Off with their heads!"

768
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,930
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

769
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,100
I don't see any mallets.

770
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,230
What are we gonna use
for mallets?

771
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,160
These flamingoes, of course.

772
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:27,030
Of course. Of course!

773
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,700
And what are we to use
for croquet balls?

774
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,130
Guinea pigs.
He's as keen as mustard.

775
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,400
What are we to use
for wickets?

776
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,860
We do have to hit the ball
through something, don't we?

777
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,560
Wickets,
assume your positions.

778
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,200
Oh, you oaf,
you move much too slowly.

779
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,930
Off with his head!

780
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,960
It's going to be
very difficult, dear,
in that position.

781
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:53,830
They're dreadfully fond of
beheading people here,
wouldn't you say?

782
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,560
The great wonder is
there's anyone left here
with a head at all.

783
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:01,100
You, impertinent child,
wipe that smile
off your face.

784
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,660
Is that smile quite gone?

785
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,960
It's left
the young lady's face.

786
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,160
But it seems to have
reappeared elsewhere.

787
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,930
It's the Cheshire Cat.

788
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,860
Oh, hello, Cheshire Cat.

789
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:24,800
Hello. How do you
like the Queen?

790
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:29,860
Not at all.
I don't like the idea
of losing my head. Would you?

791
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:32,200
I could hardly afford that.

792
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,530
I say, what is that thing?

793
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,000
It's a friend of mine,
a Cheshire Cat.

794
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,330
Allow me
to introduce you.

795
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,130
I'd rather not,
if you don't mind.

796
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,760
My dear, may I introduce
another of your subjects?

797
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,000
No, you may not.

798
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,800
Ugh.

799
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:54,030
Off with his head,
whoever or whatever it is,
and off with his tail, too.

800
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,160
There's more than one way
to skin a cat, you know.

801
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,430
I'm afraid
he hasn't got a tail.

802
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,900
You can't behead something
that has no body.

803
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,860
Well, you can try.

804
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:06,900
And exactly
who is the owner
of this monster?

805
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,030
I think it belongs
to the Duchess, Your Majesty.

806
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,100
Perhaps you'd
better ask her about it.

807
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,460
Oh, that shouldn't
be difficult, dear.

808
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,300
You put her in prison.

809
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,760
Fetch the Duchess here
and be quick about it!

810
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:31,030
When I get home,
I'll have such
wonderful stories to tell

811
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,600
about kings and queens,

812
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,330
strange creatures
in such strange lands.

813
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,900
Well, as I live and breathe,
and I hope to keep it up,

814
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,630
if it isn't the little one.

815
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,300
How are you, my dear?

816
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,360
As well as can be expected.
And you?

817
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,000
Ah, you're thinking.

818
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,760
That makes you
forget to talk.

819
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,260
Well, I can't
tell you just now
the moral to that, but...

820
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,960
Well, I'll remember in a bit.

821
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,660
Perhaps, it hasn't one.

822
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,160
Get out of here.

823
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,660
Tut-tut, my child.

824
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:17,700
Everything has a moral,
if you find it.

825
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,900
Now, the moral to that is...

826
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,900
# 'Tis love, 'tis love

827
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,530
# 'Tis love that makes
the world go round #

828
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:29,460
Well, well,
if it isn't Her Majesty.

829
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,560
Well, it is.

830
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:34,830
And that being the case,
would you be good enough
to grovel?

831
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,100
Grovel?
Yes.

832
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,700
Right here on the gravel.

833
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:40,230
Well...

834
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,530
Do you think I'm ready
for gravel-groveling?

835
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,830
Now, I give you a choice.

836
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,660
Either you or your head
must be off, and at once!

837
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:51,700
Oh, well,
I accept your generous offer,
Your Majesty. Yes, I do.

838
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,960
Ta-ta.

839
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,860
Get out of here.

840
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:59,200
Bad riddance
to good rubbish.

841
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:02,760
With all due respect,
Your Majesty,

842
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,760
I think
you've got that backwards.

843
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:07,130
Oh, have I?

844
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,060
Bad rubbish
to good riddance.

845
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:12,060
No! It's "Good riddance
to bad rubbish."

846
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,600
What mockery.

847
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:17,100
And speaking of mockery,
have you met
the Mock Turtle yet?

848
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,560
I don't think so,
Your Majesty.

849
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:23,330
But then, I don't even know
what a mock turtle is.

850
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,230
Why, it's the thing
mock turtle soup is made from.

851
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,530
Oh, you must meet him.

852
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,230
Now, you just follow that path
and you'll see him.

853
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,330
I must attend
to some executions.

854
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,130
Whatever it is,
it must be trapped in there.

855
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,500
Oh, that poor little goat.

856
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,800
There, there, don't cry.

857
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,160
Bye, little goat.

858
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,330
You hurry back
to your mother.

859
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,060
I'm sure she misses you.

860
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,700
I'm sure mine does, too.

861
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,330
Well, thank you,
I'm glad someone
appreciates me.

862
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:20,800
Thank you,
and you hurry back
to your mother, too.

863
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,230
Goodbye!

864
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:49,600
Who are you?
Are you a mock turtle?

865
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,900
A mock turtle?

866
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,530
Do I look
like a mock turtle?

867
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,000
Can't you tell
a genuine gryphon
when you see one?

868
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:01,060
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Gryphon.

869
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,100
Her Majesty told me
that I'd meet
the Mock Turtle here.

870
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,160
Oh, you mean that
"Off with his head" queen?

871
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:10,030
She's a flibbertigibbet.
Flibbertigibbet,
flibbertigibbet.

872
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,460
A "flibbiti" what?

873
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:12,930
A silly ninny.

874
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,200
All the executions
she orders,
they never come about.

875
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,800
They're all her fancy.

876
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,860
Then why does she
even order them?
Why?

877
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,400
Why? Why? Why?

878
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,830
The eternal "why"
of a child.

879
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,260
Ah, but enough
of my gryphosophy.

880
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,660
I'll take you
to the Mock Turtle. Come on.

881
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,000
Everybody says "Come on."

882
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:37,930
I never was
so ordered around before
in all my life.

883
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,760
Never!
Come on!

884
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,230
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

885
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,400
There's the Mock Turtle.
Right there.

886
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,660
Who are you?

887
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:02,130
I'm Alice.

888
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,860
Guess what his sorrow is?

889
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,300
Why, he must wanna go home.

890
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,800
I know why I'm so sad,
Mr. Mock Turtle.

891
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,830
I wanna go home.

892
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,960
I just seem to be getting
further and further away.

893
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,900
But why are you crying?

894
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,030
It's all his
morbid imagination.

895
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,900
He really has no sorrow.

896
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,260
Oh, shut up, Gryphon.

897
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:32,000
Yes, Mr. Gryphon,
please.

898
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:34,200
So, what is the matter,
Mr. Mock Turtle?

899
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,530
Oh, my dear.

900
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,760
Once I was a real turtle.

901
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,100
We went to school
in the sea.

902
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,430
My teacher
was an old turtle.

903
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,730
We used to call him Tortoise.

904
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,360
But why did you
call him Tortoise
if he was really a turtle?

905
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:52,160
We called him Tortoise
because he taught us.

906
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:55,760
Really,
you are very dull.

907
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:59,660
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself,
asking such a silly question.

908
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:02,230
Please tell me more.

909
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:07,000
Well, we had
the best of education.
Reeling and writhing,

910
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,230
and then
the different branches
of arithmetic.

911
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:13,530
Ambition, distraction,
uglification and derision.

912
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,460
Oh, shut up, Mock Turtle.
Enough about your lessons.

913
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:18,260
Why don't you sing
the little girl a song?

914
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,030
Well, if I'm going
to sing anything,

915
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:22,000
I suppose a song
is a good choice.

916
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,660
Oh, I don't know.

917
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:25,260
You could sing her
a sea chantey.

918
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,830
That's a thought.

919
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,360
I used to live
in a sea shanty.

920
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,800
Oh?
But I didn't
care for it much.

921
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,560
For the roof leaked,
as I recall.

922
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,500
Now, really, Mr. Turtle.

923
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,400
Oh, you don't
have to be so formal.

924
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,430
You can call me
by my first name.

925
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,960
And what is that?

926
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,000
Mock.
That's what my mother
used to call me.

927
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,330
"Mock," she'd say...

928
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,600
Well, whoever you are
and whatever you are,

929
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,830
absolutely nothing you say
makes any sense at all.

930
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,400
Oh, that's
the nicest compliment
I've ever been paid.

931
01:14:55,460 --> 01:15:00,230
There's too much sense
in the world for me,
in my humble opinion.

932
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,230
# Please tell me, young lady,
just what is so good #

933
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:10,500
# About never once
being misunderstood #

934
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,160
# There's far too much
accurate communication #

935
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:19,030
# And if it continues

936
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,960
# I fear for the nation

937
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:31,900
# Nonsense! Nonsense!
That's what
we're terribly short of #

938
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,300
# Don't you love nonsense?

939
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,600
I'm not really sure.
Well, sort of.

940
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,200
# We're getting lethargic
from aiming at logic #

941
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,030
# Let's put a stop to that

942
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:45,960
# If you don't love nonsense
I'll knock off your hat! #

943
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:58,800
# Nonsense! Nonsense!
Simply can't do without it #

944
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:03,400
# Burn incense to nonsense
and sing us a song about it #

945
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:08,260
# Let young master Billy
be hopelessly silly
until he is blue in the face #

946
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:15,100
# We must never be grave
'Tis nonsense will save #

947
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,800
# The blooming human race

948
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:50,300
# Nonsense! Nonsense!
Simply can't do without it #

949
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,730
# Burn incense to nonsense
and sing us a song about it #

950
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,900
# Let young master Billy
be hopelessly silly
until he is blue in the face #

951
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,200
# We must never be grave

952
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,500
# 'Tis nonsense will save

953
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:12,260
# The blooming human race! #

954
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,400
Now, tell us
about your adventures.

955
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,300
I would tell you
my adventures beginning
from this morning,

956
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,030
but it's no use
going back to yesterday

957
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,760
because I was
a different person then.

958
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:44,130
The trial's beginning!
The trial's beginning!

959
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,330
Come on, come on!
What trial is it?

960
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,660
Never mind.
Never mind. Come on.

961
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,930
Bye, Alice. Bye, Gryphon.

962
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,030
I wish
they'd get the trial done

963
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,100
and pass out
the refreshments.

964
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,230
What are they doing?

965
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,200
They can't have anything
to write down yet,
before the trial's begun.

966
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,200
They're writing down
the names

967
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,200
for fear
they should forget them
before the end of the trial.

968
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,700
Silence in court!

969
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,860
Silence in the court.

970
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,860
Herald, read the accusation.

971
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:54,730
"The Queen of Hearts,
she made some tarts
All on a summer day

972
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,130
"The Knave of Hearts,
he stole some tarts
And took them quite away!"

973
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,700
Consider your verdict.

974
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,230
Oh, no, no, no, no,
Your Majesty. Not yet.

975
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,330
Not yet.
There's a lot more to come.
Really?

976
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,460
Call the first witness!

977
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,530
Call the first witness!

978
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,460
Call the first witness!

979
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,060
Oh, I beg your pardon,
Your Majesty,

980
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:30,560
I was just finishing my tea
when they dragged me in here.

981
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,460
You should have
finished your tea.

982
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:33,760
When did you begin?

983
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,960
The 14th of March,
I think it was.
15th.

984
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,200
16th!

985
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,760
Don't be impertinent.

986
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,430
Give your evidence
or I'll have you
executed on the spot.

987
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,400
Oh, oh, my dear,
did you hear that?

988
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,130
Bravo!

989
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,260
Oh, Your Honor,
I'm a very poor man,

990
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,960
and I had just begun my tea
not more than
a week or so ago,

991
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:55,330
and what with the bread
and butter getting thinner

992
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,200
and the twinkling of the tea.

993
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,130
The twinkling of the what?

994
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,030
It began with the tea.

995
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,860
Well, of course,
twinkling begins with a "T."

996
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:07,700
Everybody knows that.
Do you think I'm a dunce?

997
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,660
Your Honor, I'm a poor man,

998
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:13,060
and most things
began to twinkle after that.

999
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,330
Only the March Hare said...
I didn't.

1000
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,700
You did.

1001
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,930
I didn't.

1002
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,930
You did!
I didn't.

1003
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,160
You did!

1004
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:24,100
# Why deny it?
Be a good sport #

1005
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,860
# I'll explain it
to all of the court #

1006
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,560
# I offered you tea
and you drank a quart #

1007
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,660
# I didn't, I didn't

1008
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,200
# You did!

1009
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,830
# I didn't, I didn't!
# You did! #

1010
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,760
He denies it. Strike it out.

1011
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,230
Your Majesty,
I'm a poor man.

1012
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,660
You're a very poor speaker,
too.

1013
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,230
If that's all
you know about the case,
you may stand down.

1014
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,930
Stand down, Your Majesty?

1015
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,760
But I can
hardly get any lower.

1016
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,400
I'm on the floor as it is.

1017
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,400
Well, then, simply go!
Of course.

1018
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,500
And just
take his head off outside.

1019
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,660
Where he goes, I go.

1020
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,030
Call the next witness.

1021
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,830
Call the next witness!

1022
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,900
Call the next witness!

1023
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:50,930
Give your evidence.
No, I won't.

1024
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:56,860
Your Majesty, you must
cross-examine the witness.

1025
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:59,260
Must I?
Of course you must.

1026
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,400
Why must I?
Because I say so.

1027
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,760
Oh, of course.
That's different. Yes, yes.

1028
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:06,730
What are tarts made of?

1029
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,260
What?
Tarts.

1030
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,630
What is a tart made of?

1031
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,860
Well, tart starts with a "T."

1032
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,830
Then you add an "A,"
then you add an "R,"
then you add...

1033
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,060
No! What are the ingredients?

1034
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:26,430
Well, pepper.
Lots of pepper!

1035
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,200
They most certainly
are not!

1036
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,200
They are made of treacle!

1037
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:34,260
Pepper! Pepper!
Pepper! Pepper! Pepper!
Treacle! Treacle! Treacle!

1038
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,660
Treacle! Treacle!
Pepper!

1039
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,160
You are an idiot,
it's pepper!
Treacle! Treacle!

1040
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,930
Off with his head!

1041
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,360
And after that,
pinch off his whiskers.

1042
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,630
And off with her head, too!

1043
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,460
Treacle. Treacle. Treacle.

1044
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,960
Pepper.

1045
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:54,160
Thank you for taking over
the cross-examination,
my dear.

1046
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,260
It was giving me
rather a headache.

1047
01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:00,260
Well, if these examinations
are really supposed
to be cross,

1048
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:02,800
I am much better
at that sort of thing
than you are.

1049
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,660
How true. How true.

1050
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,000
Have we a verdict?

1051
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,730
You haven't got
any evidence yet.

1052
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,860
Silence!

1053
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:24,400
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

1054
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,260
You're growing, young lady.

1055
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:40,600
But I didn't
eat a piece of mushroom
or drink anything.

1056
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,200
There's no doubt about it.

1057
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,700
You're growing up.

1058
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:00,060
Can you...
Can you hear me
up there?

1059
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,230
Alice,
you're the next witness.

1060
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,630
I can hear you.

1061
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,400
She's a monster.

1062
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:09,600
The Queen should chop her
down to size right now.

1063
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,530
What do you know
about this business?

1064
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,000
Nothing.

1065
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:15,760
Nothing whatever?

1066
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:17,730
Nothing whatever.

1067
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,600
Oh, that's very important.

1068
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:22,900
How could it
possibly be important?

1069
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,860
Unimportant,
Your Majesty means,
of course.

1070
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:29,300
Unimportant,
I meant, of course.

1071
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,360
Rule 42.

1072
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:36,430
All persons over a mile high
are to leave the court.

1073
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,260
I'm not a mile high.

1074
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:39,800
Yes, you are.

1075
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,800
I most certainly am not!

1076
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:44,130
Nearly two miles high.

1077
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,200
I don't mean to be rude,
Your Highness,

1078
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,060
but you really don't know
what you're talking about.

1079
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,400
Besides,
it's not a regular rule.

1080
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,360
You invented it just now.

1081
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:56,900
Young lady,
that is the oldest rule
in the book.

1082
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,300
Then it ought
to be number one.

1083
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,360
Give me a verdict.
Give me a verdict!

1084
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,430
But there's more
evidence to come yet.

1085
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,860
Please, Your Majesty.

1086
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:10,030
A very important envelope
has just been found.

1087
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,230
Why don't you just
let the poor prisoner go?

1088
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,760
You can see he's a nice man.

1089
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:17,800
What's in the envelope?

1090
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,960
Your Majesty,
a set of verses.

1091
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:23,930
Your Majesty, please.
I didn't write them.

1092
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,960
The Knave didn't sign them.

1093
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:34,460
In fact, nobody signed them.

1094
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,930
That proves his guilt.
Off with his head.

1095
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,360
Off with his head.

1096
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:40,100
It doesn't prove anything!

1097
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,260
And you really
ought to stop yelling
"Off with everybody's head."

1098
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:45,660
It's a terrible habit
you have.

1099
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,300
Silence! Silence!

1100
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,860
Just set the prisoner free
and let him go home.

1101
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:00,700
His family probably
misses him very much.

1102
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,800
And one of the worst feelings
in the whole world
is to be homesick.

1103
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,330
I ought to know.

1104
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,830
Give me a verdict.
Give me a verdict!

1105
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,700
How can they give a verdict
when there isn't

1106
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,830
a bit of meaning
in this whole trial?

1107
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,760
Oh, well,
if there's no meaning,

1108
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,930
that saves us
a world of trouble.

1109
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,700
We don't have to try
and find any.

1110
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,660
Sentence first,
verdict after.

1111
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:23,160
Are you crazy?

1112
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:24,860
You can't have
the sentence first.

1113
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,100
Hold your tongue.

1114
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,800
I will not hold my tongue!

1115
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:29,060
Hold yours!

1116
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,460
Ooh! Off with her head!
Off with her head!

1117
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,300
Get her. Grab her.
Grab her.

1118
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,800
Off with her head!

1119
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,430
Off with her head!
Off with her head!

1120
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,060
Off with her head!

1121
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,630
I'm not afraid of you.

1122
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,500
You're nothing
but a pack of cards!

1123
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,530
Ouch! Stop it! Stop it!

1124
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,060
You wicked little thing!

1125
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:15,330
After her!

1126
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,560
Faster!
Faster! Get her! Catch her!

1127
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:19,930
Get her!

1128
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:37,960
Mother, Father, I'm back!

1129
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:46,830
Mother? Father? Anybody?

1130
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,930
Dinah, I'm home! I'm home!

1131
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,100
What are you doing
on that side of the mirror?

1132
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,660
Mother! Father!
I'm here! Look!

1133
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:51,800
I'm here! I'm here!

1134
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:54,460
On the other side
of the mirror!

1135
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:58,260
Mother! Father!
Help me, I'm here!

1136
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,560
Mother! Father! I'm here!

1137
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:09,960
On the other side
of the mirror.

1138
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,700
"Jabberwocky."

1139
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,530
"Twas brillig,
and the slithy toves

1140
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,460
"Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

1141
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:03,230
"All mimsy
were the borogoves

1142
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,100
"And the mome raths outgrabe

1143
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,930
"Beware the Jabberwock,
my son!
The jaws that bite

1144
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,730
"the claws that catch!

1145
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,730
"Beware the Jubjub bird,
and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"

1146
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:24,230
I can just tell
this is supposed
to be a scary poem.

1147
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,000
It's a good thing
I'm grown up

1148
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:29,260
or I probably would be
a little frightened.

1149
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,700
Thunder doesn't frighten me.

1150
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,360
And I'm not
the least bit afraid.
