1
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,539
No.

2
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,821
No means no.

3
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,132
<i>Bonjour.</i>

4
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,735
<i>Carl, I know it's you.</i>

5
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,599
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:00,274
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,740
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send. "

8
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,105
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:07,612
<i>Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.</i>

10
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,340
<i>So, what are you doing?</i>

11
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,783
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,422
<i>- You did get my text, right?
- What? Text? What?</i>

13
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,023
<i>We're all going out tonight.</i>

14
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,786
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:20,985
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:23,028
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:24,460
<i>No, I don't at all.</i>

18
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:27,796
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:30,699
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:32,100
<i>Thing? What thing?</i>

21
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:33,764
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:36,877
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:39,275
<i>...but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.</i>

24
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:42,541
<i>I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.</i>

25
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:44,309
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:47,580
<i>Specific things.
Like "get in line at the video store"?</i>

27
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,883
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:52,549
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:56,163
<i>I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.</i>

30
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,130
<i>- That's not me.
- It's not?</i>

31
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:03,999
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:06,231
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,000
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,200
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:12,312
...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,006
<i>Carl, I know you're not saying anything.</i>

37
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,450
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,283
- What? All right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,186
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,821
Hi.

41
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,194
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,804
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,770
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:41,875
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:45,638
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:47,372
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,017
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:52,619
...because we have an announcement
to make.

49
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,687
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,419
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:57,592 --> 00:02:58,889
We're engaged.

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,460
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,191
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,232
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,767
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,768
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,407
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

58
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:18,178
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

59
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:20,405
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,607
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,020
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,781
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:30,550
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:33,785
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:37,022
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,127
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:45,103
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,971
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,239
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,713
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:58,079
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:00,881
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:03,081
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,623
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,055
Hey.

76
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,320
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:11,488
<i>- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.</i>

78
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,263
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:16,961
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:18,730
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:22,468
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:25,670
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

83
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:28,748
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:32,580
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:37,523
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

86
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,250
Whoa!

87
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,932
See you, guys.

88
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:12,654
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:15,159
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,457
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

91
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:20,533
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,294
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,735
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:28,171
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

95
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,768
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:33,505
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:37,014
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,149
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:44,284
Persianwifefinder. com.
No, thank you.

100
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:48,523
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:51,489
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,563
Here we go.

103
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:59,673
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,942
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,836
Norman. Line one.

106
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:09,383
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,611
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:14,744
You're with Norman.

109
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:20,584
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,093
Okay.

111
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,458
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,033
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:30,296
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

114
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,997
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:36,075
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:39,645
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:42,908
Look at it this way:
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,882
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:49,652
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:51,724
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:56,626
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:59,858
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

123
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:03,970
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,563
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,132
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,470
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:13,013
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,809
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

129
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:19,044
...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

130
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,255
I admit, business has been slow.

131
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:25,358
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

132
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,586
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

133
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:31,196
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

134
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,268
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

135
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:36,596
- None.
- And your credit...

136
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,296
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

137
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:42,500
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

138
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:56,184
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

139
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:59,190
Nick Lane? Hey.

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,329
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:06,627
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

142
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,826
You must be running this place by now.

143
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:12,495
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

144
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,073
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

145
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,903
God.

146
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,036
She's good. What have you been doing?

147
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:22,376
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

148
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,077
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

149
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,812
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

150
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,981
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

151
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,390
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

152
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:36,522
I'm a yes man.

153
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,664
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

154
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,563
No, thanks. I'm fine.

155
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,499
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine. "

156
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,332
Wow. Okay.

157
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:50,000
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:52,006
No, you don't.

159
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,871
Why don't you take this rock...

160
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,177
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

161
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:01,345
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

162
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:04,116
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

163
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,257
Oh, my God.

164
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:09,623
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

165
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,122
<i>Stay right there.</i>

166
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,130
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

167
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:21,635
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

168
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,676
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

169
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,987
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

170
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:38,616
Sorry.

171
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,290
<i>- Hello?
- Stephanie?</i>

172
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,795
<i>- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

173
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:49,096
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

174
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,027
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

175
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:54,402
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

176
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:56,600
Good for you. Good for you.

177
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:11,514
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

178
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,628
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

179
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:33,313
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

180
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:37,850
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

181
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,384
You're so full of shit.

182
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,189
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

183
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:47,156
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

184
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:50,895
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

185
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:54,296
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

186
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:57,029
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

187
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:00,072
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

188
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,607
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:06,804
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

190
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,973
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

191
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,551
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

192
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,884
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

193
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,585
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

194
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,196
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down. "

195
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:25,559
I mean, do you even know
my fiancee's last name?

196
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,702
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

197
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,102
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

198
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:36,505
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

199
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,167
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

200
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:40,708
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

201
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:43,578
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

202
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:47,246
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

203
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,286
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

204
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:52,551
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

205
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:56,060
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up lonely.

206
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,600
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

207
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,135
Hey, Carl.

208
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,914
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

209
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:21,254
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

210
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,985
Nope. No more than usual.

211
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,959
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

212
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,668
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

213
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,598
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,932
He never did much.

215
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,437
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

216
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:43,075
Wasn't a good anything.

217
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:47,237
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

218
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,246
Now, that's upsetting.

219
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,056
What was that?

220
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,035
<i>Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.</i>

221
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:46,899
<i>Please, find a seat.</i>

222
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,401
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

223
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,102
Carl, man, hey.

224
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,373
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

225
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:56,747
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

226
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:59,079
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

227
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:03,087
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

228
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:07,284
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

229
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,929
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

230
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,291
That's why you're here.

231
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:15,333
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

232
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,331
It's starting.

233
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:19,863
<i>Life.</i>

234
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,768
<i>We are all living it. Or are we?</i>

235
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,310
Ooh, heavy.

236
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:31,884
<i>Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?</i>

237
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,180
<i>From the external.</i>

238
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:38,416
<i>And how do we control the external?
With one word.</i>

239
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:40,524
<i>And what is that word?</i>

240
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,088
- Yes!
- Jeez.

241
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,259
Yes.

242
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:48,926
Yes.

243
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:53,638
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,241
- Yes!
- Whoo!

245
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,747
The word is "yes. "

246
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:07,785
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,217
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

248
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,085
Say it a million more times.

249
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,558
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

250
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,857
Yes!

251
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,897
Yes.

252
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:31,076
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

253
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:36,080
...because it will RSVP "yes. "

254
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:42,146
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

255
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:48,751
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

256
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:55,702
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

257
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:03,042
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

258
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,337
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

259
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:11,782
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

260
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:19,351
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

261
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,159
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

262
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,000
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

263
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,567
Thank you.

264
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,801
Back up just a little bit more.

265
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,741
<i>- No.
- No man. No man.</i>

266
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:41,973
<i>No man. No man. No man.</i>

267
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:43,343
<i>No man. No man.</i>

268
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:44,916
Okay.

269
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:49,589
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

270
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,982
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

271
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:03,194
What's your name?

272
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:06,438
Carl.

273
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,239
Let me guess, Carl.

274
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:11,071
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

275
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,670
- Yes.
- Yes!

276
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,580
And you're not sure about this, are you?

277
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:20,210
No.

278
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:24,448
<i>No man. No man.
No man. No man.</i>

279
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,252
You're dead, Carl.

280
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:30,360
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

281
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,528
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

282
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,066
...and to yourself.

283
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:39,130
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

284
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:43,538
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

285
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,576
And you lost the love of your life...

286
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:48,738
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

287
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:56,552
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

288
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:00,888
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

289
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:04,022
Am I right, Carl?

290
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:11,896
I have had some trouble.

291
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,937
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

292
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:25,574
<i>- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh...</i>

293
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:28,545
The word is "yes," Carl.

294
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:29,950
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:31,148
- Yes!
- Yes.

296
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,815
Yes!

297
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,854
Once you leave this building...

298
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,022
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

299
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,998
...no matter what it is...

300
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,229
...you will say yes.

301
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:46,498
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:47,971
- Yes.
- Yes!

303
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,235
- Yes.
- Yes.

304
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,442
What if I...

305
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:56,343
say

306
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:58,308
...the other word?

307
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,054
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

308
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:06,250
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

309
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:09,726
...things can get a little dicey.

310
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,457
What do you say, Carl?

311
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:16,097
Are you ready to make a covenant?

312
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,031
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

313
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:19,502
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:21,800
- Yes.
- Again.

315
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,409
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:25,408
- Say it again.
- Yes!

317
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:31,182
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:36,047
Yes!

319
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:05,776
Hey, there he is.

320
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,716
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

321
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,253
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

322
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:11,721
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

323
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:15,350
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,727
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

325
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:25,099
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

326
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,636
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

327
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:31,373
<i>Oh. Ugh...</i>

328
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:32,910
Yes!

329
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:37,342
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

330
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, why not?

331
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:46,452
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

332
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:56,495
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

333
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:28,995
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

334
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:31,364
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

335
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:35,133
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

336
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:37,038
Go ahead.

337
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,869
And what did you say?

338
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:46,446
Oh, I'm just right
over here. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,282
What? Hello? Hello?

340
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,158
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

341
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:53,987
Oh, great.

342
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:59,188
<i>- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.</i>

343
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:02,824
I mean, it's real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

344
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,669
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

345
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,507
No problem. Have a good night.

346
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:12,311
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

347
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,705
Okay.

348
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,909
I've come this far.

349
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:22,515
Yes, you can.

350
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,419
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

351
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,566
Sure. It's all yours.

352
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,938
God bless you, man.

353
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,795
Oh, come on.

354
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:05,762
Come on, come on.

355
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:11,432
Perfect.

356
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:15,973
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give
all your money away to a homeless guy?

357
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,633
Yes, yes, I do.

358
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,335
Letting him
burn out your phone...

359
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:21,777
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

360
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:24,440
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

361
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:27,449
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

362
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:30,988
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

363
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:50,139
Come on, man.

364
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:56,104
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

365
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:16,092
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

366
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,364
Oh, could I? Could I really?

367
00:24:20,774 --> 00:24:22,264
That's a good look.

368
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:27,704
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

369
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,010
Did you just run out of gas?

370
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:32,782
Maybe.

371
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:38,447
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

372
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,456
When you were driving
out of your way...

373
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:44,393
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

374
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:47,363
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

375
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:49,934
No. Why would you assume that?

376
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:53,135
He used up your phone?

377
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:57,243
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

378
00:24:57,411 --> 00:25:00,005
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

379
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,172
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

380
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,978
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

381
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:08,644
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

382
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:11,018
Well, do you need a ride?

383
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,650
On that thing?

384
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,532
Am I going too fast for you?

385
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:29,574
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

386
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:32,507
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

387
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,409
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

388
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:49,592
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

389
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:55,527
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

390
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:12,009
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

391
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:16,486
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

392
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:19,888
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

393
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,052
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

394
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,722
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

395
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:32,469
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

396
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:33,799
Yeah.

397
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,139
Thanks.

398
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,438
So you okay?

399
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:42,810
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

400
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:45,508
- What?
- What did you say?

401
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,747
Hey, I...

402
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:58,088
Have a good night.

403
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,290
Yes.

404
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,168
"Yes always leads
to something good.

405
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,402
Never avoid opportunities.

406
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,669
They may come in any form. "

407
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:52,413
<i>- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.</i>

408
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:55,521
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

409
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:57,418
I guess.

410
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:01,559
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

411
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,389
Is there any way you could come in?

412
00:28:04,397 --> 00:28:05,625
Sure.

413
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,257
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

414
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:13,668
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

415
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:21,770
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

416
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,008
Right.

417
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,245
Like I need that.

418
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:35,493
<i>- Persian wifefinder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.</i>

419
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:38,153
<i>Would you be the man for me?</i>

420
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:40,361
I guess so.

421
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:44,733
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

422
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,202
And what's your business?

423
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:49,604
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

424
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,969
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

425
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:57,039
Oh. Yeah, right.

426
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,583
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

427
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:02,285
So, what do you think?

428
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,183
I think yes.

429
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:13,990
Inta-maresting.

430
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:15,934
Cakes, huh?

431
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:20,198
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

432
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,038
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,737
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

434
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:31,748
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

435
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:33,817
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

436
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:36,182
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

437
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:38,221
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

438
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:39,415
What?

439
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:44,155
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

440
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:47,926
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

441
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:50,535
...whichever, or I walk. "

442
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:52,968
Really? What did they say?

443
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:56,870
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

444
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:59,375
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

445
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:03,004
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

446
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:04,807
And?

447
00:30:05,018 --> 00:30:06,349
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

448
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,282
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

449
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:10,184
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

450
00:30:10,357 --> 00:30:12,222
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

451
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:14,690
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

452
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:17,056
- No.
- How did you know that?

453
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,254
He's not here.

454
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:20,797
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

455
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:23,959
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

456
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:27,636
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:31,834
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

458
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:34,845
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

459
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:37,882
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

460
00:30:39,786 --> 00:30:40,810
See what I did there?

461
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:46,289
I joined "bro" with "Joseph. " Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

462
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:48,283
Very cool, Norm.

463
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:55,357
I have been such a dick and a douche.

464
00:30:55,802 --> 00:30:58,168
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

465
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:01,136
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

466
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:05,970
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

467
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:08,671
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

468
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:12,614
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

469
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:16,813
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

470
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,959
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

471
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:22,390
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

472
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:24,427
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

473
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,566
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

474
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:33,865
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

475
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,405
Okay.

476
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:43,746
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

477
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:47,114
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

478
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:52,615
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

479
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:58,562
Argh!

480
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:02,734
Okay, okay.

481
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:24,149
He did it.

482
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,465
Drinks on me.

483
00:32:36,336 --> 00:32:37,530
Crazy, man.

484
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:40,303
Carl, that was so awesome.

485
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:42,941
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

486
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,940
Absolutely.

487
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:49,309
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

488
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:54,253
Was I chewing gum before?

489
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:56,946
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

490
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:59,785
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

491
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:05,158
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

492
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:08,494
I made a sacred "conevant. "

493
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:10,629
That sounded naughty.

494
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:14,069
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

495
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,573
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

496
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:20,571
Okay. But if I win...

497
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:24,615
...I get to take that pretty girl of yours
to a ball...

498
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:27,116
...because she deserves that.

499
00:33:27,287 --> 00:33:30,745
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

500
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:33,482
That is so nice.

501
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,388
Oh, shit.

502
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:45,131
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

503
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,933
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

504
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,803
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

505
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:52,706
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

506
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:54,813
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

507
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:58,542
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

508
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,982
You want some, huh, more?

509
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:04,521
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

510
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:06,750
Oh, where'd I go?

511
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:09,019
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

512
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:13,629
<i>Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?</i>

513
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:16,433
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

514
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:20,369
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

515
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,134
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

516
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:27,444
Just don't break my teeth
off on the curb, okay?

517
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:31,482
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

518
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:32,675
What?

519
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:37,653
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

520
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:41,191
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

521
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:48,465
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

522
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:51,396
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

523
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:53,095
That's why you got punched out...

524
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:56,834
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

525
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,409
I'm over here, dickhole.

526
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:02,540
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

527
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,840
You're a complete...

528
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,143
You all right?

529
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,413
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

530
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:11,318
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

531
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,482
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

532
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,525
I'm glad we had this experience.

533
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:21,095
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

534
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:27,937
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

535
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:33,578
She's never gonna go to a ball.

536
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:36,544
No. No, she's not.

537
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:12,275
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

538
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:13,851
What can I do for you?

539
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,353
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

540
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:19,950
Oh, really?

541
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:32,297
Okay. That should just about do it.

542
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:35,873
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

543
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:39,607
Oh, not so fast.

544
00:36:40,213 --> 00:36:41,612
What are you doing?

545
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:46,418
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

546
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:49,146
I'm getting so forgetful.

547
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:52,382
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:55,356
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

549
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:59,624
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

550
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,358
You are so handsome.

551
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,067
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

552
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:13,907
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

553
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,742
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

554
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,749
You know, a sexual release?

555
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:21,283
<i>Uh...</i>

556
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:26,521
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

557
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,356
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

558
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,897
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

559
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:37,127
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

560
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:40,568
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

561
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,700
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

562
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:50,006
In my nightmares.

563
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:53,648
Oh, come on, give me a break.

564
00:37:54,654 --> 00:37:57,851
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

565
00:37:58,024 --> 00:38:02,757
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

566
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:17,867
Nice dog.

567
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:33,924
Just relax. I'll handle this.

568
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:41,190
Oh, God!

569

<i>Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...</i>

570
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:47,865
Wow.

Hi.

577
00:39:58,044 --> 00:40:01,536
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

578
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:04,581
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a. m. and 5:30?

579

Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

580
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:10,921
...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

Yeah. All right.

Hey. It's really working. Ah!

It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

What did he call me?

00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,446
Homeless.

There you are. You want some?

Yeah.

Oh, yes, there was.

608

And we were that band.

Yes, we were.

And that band made rock 'n' roll.

Oh, yes, they did.

To break up with you</i>

618
00:42:56,789 --> 00:42:58,723
<i>You said, "Who are you?"</i>

619
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,722
<i>Who are you?</i>

620
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:06,297
<i>I wanna snap your neck and spit on you
You said, "Who are you?"</i>

621
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:08,330
<i>Who are you?</i>

622
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:13,764
<i>If I got a call that said you were dead
You said, "Who are you?"</i>

623
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,964
<i>Who are you?</i>

624
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:20,909
<i>I'd shrug my shoulders, and I'd say whatevs
You said, "Who are you?"</i>

625
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,571
<i>Who are you?</i>

626
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:28,186
Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He's a computer hacker.

627
00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:31,812
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

628
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:36,360
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

629
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:38,429
Happy networking, asshole.

630
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:59,276
<i>Don't call me past 11 p. m.
It won't happen again</i>

631
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:01,317
<i>Happened once, it happened twice</i>

632
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:05,150
<i>It happened three times,
Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe</i>

633
00:44:05,324 --> 00:44:08,259
<i>Maybe it happened six times
But it won't happen a seventh time</i>

634
00:44:08,427 --> 00:44:10,327
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

635
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:17,960
<i>I'm not your late night booty call</i>

636
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,330
<i>Whore no more</i>

637
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:27,411
<i>Don't call me past 11 p. m.
It won't happen again</i>

638
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:29,742
<i>You can call me at 10:59</i>

639
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:34,443
<i>But don't call me at 11
'Cause that's my rule now</i>

640
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,321
Can I get a water?

641
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:55,167
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

642
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:58,742
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

643
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:01,675
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

644
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:03,815
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

645
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:06,543
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

646
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,688
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

647
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:15,720
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

648
00:45:15,895 --> 00:45:19,262
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

649
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:22,264
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

650
00:45:22,434 --> 00:45:23,731
You want a drink?

651
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:27,099
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

652
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:30,436
<i>- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?</i>

653
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:35,271
But you can walk me to my scooter.

654
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:39,082
I teach a jogging photo group...

655
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:43,654
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

656
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:46,223
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

657
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:50,385
It's in Griffith Park
and we do a loop. It's about five miles.

658
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:52,861
It's at 6 a. m.

659
00:45:53,032 --> 00:45:57,298
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a. m.
In, like, never.

660
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:01,599
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

661
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:04,408
Okay, so you're in a band...

662
00:46:04,577 --> 00:46:07,671
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

663
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,973
Whatever I want.

664
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:13,516
I volunteer at a shelter. I paint a little bit.

665
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:16,120
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

666
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:18,552
And some nude modeling, FYI.

667
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,919
<i>Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...</i>

668
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:28,698
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

669
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:30,961
I didn't ask you out.

670
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:33,331
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

671
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:34,904
You said that.

672
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:37,702
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

673
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,604
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

674
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:46,842
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

675
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:48,213
Yeah, I'd love to.

676
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:53,690
<i>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...</i>

677
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:57,124
- Carl.
- Allison.

678
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:14,970
Yeah, Rooney?

679
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:16,876
<i>Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.</i>

680
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:20,610
<i>Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?</i>

681
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:22,344
Yeah.

682
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:32,363
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

683
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:33,793
- Allison?
- Yeah?

684
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:35,831
Do we need to use a flash?

685
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:37,832
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

686
00:47:46,278 --> 00:47:49,509
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

687
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:52,480
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

688
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:56,712
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

689
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:59,949
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

690
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:04,061
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

691
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,855
Allison, I'm here.

692
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:09,694
Allison.

693
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,062
Hey. Who were those guys?

694
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,538
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

695
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,611
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

696
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:23,077
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

697
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:26,979
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

698
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:29,017
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

699
00:48:29,188 --> 00:48:31,554
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

700
00:48:31,724 --> 00:48:35,160
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

701
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,057
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

702
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,222
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

703
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,800
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

704
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:45,561
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

705
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:46,864
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

706
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:48,266
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

707
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,738
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

708
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:53,002
Red Bull.

709
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,243
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

710
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,817
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

711
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,181
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

712
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:13,756
Oh, it's a good one.

713
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:16,857
Hold that.

714
00:49:18,203 --> 00:49:19,329
Got it.

715
00:49:29,448 --> 00:49:31,507
Hey, Carl, you okay?

716
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:36,244
Hold it right there.

717
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,060
That's good.

718
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:59,300
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

719
00:49:59,678 --> 00:50:01,612
Kind of mysterious.

720
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,906
You know, listen.

721
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:06,518
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

722
00:50:06,685 --> 00:50:09,017
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

723
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,053
I love that.

724
00:50:11,223 --> 00:50:14,420
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

725
00:50:14,593 --> 00:50:16,652
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

726
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:20,265
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

727
00:50:20,432 --> 00:50:23,094
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

728
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:26,931
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

729
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:30,837
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life. "

730
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,738
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

731
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:36,672
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

732
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:40,114
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

733
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:43,686
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

734
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:46,115
Might be.

735
00:50:47,025 --> 00:50:49,994
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

736
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:53,427
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

737
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,591
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

738
00:50:56,768 --> 00:51:00,397
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

739
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:01,937
Gone, never saw him again.

740
00:51:02,808 --> 00:51:06,505
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

741
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:10,039
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

742
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:11,307
Kind of dragged on.

743
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:13,815
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

744
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:18,519
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

745
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:32,236
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

746
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:34,872
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

747
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,530
She's the complete opposite of me.

748
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,006
Carl, could you
please pass the Cholula?

749
00:51:39,178 --> 00:51:41,146
Sure, Faranoush.

750
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,513
How did you two meet again?

751
00:51:43,682 --> 00:51:47,345
Persianwifefinder. Com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

752
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:49,919
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

753
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:52,488
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

754
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:55,525
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

755
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:59,528
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

756
00:51:59,698 --> 00:52:01,097
Sorry, Faranoush.

757
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,500
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

758
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:07,832
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

759
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:10,406
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

760
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:13,670
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

761
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:17,372
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

762
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,750
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

763
00:52:24,623 --> 00:52:28,855
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

764
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,760
So my friends are being really lame...

765
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:36,094
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

766
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:38,634
Hey, I have an idea.

767
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,872
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

768
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:45,142
Yeah. Sure.

769
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,540
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

770
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:49,271
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

771
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:57,180
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:57,356 --> 00:53:00,382
Well, thanks, Carl.

773
00:53:00,759 --> 00:53:04,820
Thanks, that's really sweet.

774
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:07,129
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

775
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:09,290
Thanks, Faranoush.

776
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:12,332
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

777
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:13,766
Costumes for what?

778
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:17,868
<i>Expelliarmus! Just kidding.</i>

779
00:53:18,043 --> 00:53:20,136
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

780
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:24,112
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

781
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:26,843
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

782
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:30,284
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

783
00:53:31,323 --> 00:53:32,551
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

784
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:36,888
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

785
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:40,891
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

786
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:42,693
...chips, dips...

787
00:53:42,868 --> 00:53:46,201
...and good people, just like you two.

788
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,336
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

789
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:50,236
It's gonna be a crazy night.

790
00:53:55,947 --> 00:53:58,643
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

791
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:01,342
- Good dip, huh, H.P.?
- Mm.

792
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,684
Got tons of it at Costco. You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

793
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:08,826
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

794
00:54:08,994 --> 00:54:12,589
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

795
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:15,125
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

796
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,263
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

797
00:54:20,038 --> 00:54:22,632
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

798
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:27,278
<i>Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?</i>

799
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:31,139
"I'm not going home, not really. "

800
00:54:33,985 --> 00:54:35,782
<i>Oh, bye.</i>

801
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:43,750
<i>Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets?</i>

802
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:55,431
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

803
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:58,132
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

804
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:01,541
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

805
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:05,513
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

806
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:09,017
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

807
00:55:09,187 --> 00:55:10,984
- That's all right.
- Bye.

808
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:14,250
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

809
00:55:14,426 --> 00:55:16,485
Next stop, Azkaban.

810
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:26,198
Hey.

811
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,766
Do you wanna drive?

812
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:38,447
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

813
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:42,083
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

814
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:50,157
I got an idea.

815
00:55:55,834 --> 00:56:00,134
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

816
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:07,577
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

817
00:56:10,482 --> 00:56:15,385
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

818
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:43,939
This is unreal.

819
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:46,309
I couldn't agree more.

820
00:56:56,528 --> 00:56:57,859
<i>Ooh</i>

821
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:01,655
<i>Ooh</i>

822
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:08,702
<i>Ooh</i>

823
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:27,989
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

824
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:32,324
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

825
00:57:56,755 --> 00:57:58,814
Good evening, Los Angeles.

826
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:02,187
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

827
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:05,489
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

828
00:58:05,664 --> 00:58:06,858
I killed her.

829
00:58:08,366 --> 00:58:09,628
I'm a somebody.

830
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:13,030
I don't know about that.

831
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:15,798
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

832
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:19,171
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:22,074
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

834
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:27,241
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

835
00:58:27,419 --> 00:58:31,583
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

836
00:58:31,756 --> 00:58:36,625
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

837
00:58:36,795 --> 00:58:39,730
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

838
00:58:39,898 --> 00:58:41,729
- What?
- I love doing it.

839
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,700
It's like my photography.

840
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:46,336
I know there isn't that much demand
for photographs...

841
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:48,096
<i>...taken while running, but...</i>

842
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,400
I wasn't gonna say anything.

843
00:58:50,575 --> 00:58:54,102
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

844
00:58:54,279 --> 00:58:55,871
You know that when you're a kid...

845
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:58,675
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

846
00:58:59,484 --> 00:59:01,418
I love your music.

847
00:59:01,686 --> 00:59:04,519
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

848
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:09,085
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

849
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,921
- Stop.
- Stopping.

850
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:13,394
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

851
00:59:13,565 --> 00:59:14,964
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

852
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,896
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

853
00:59:17,068 --> 00:59:21,505
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

854
00:59:24,676 --> 00:59:25,904
Run!

855
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:27,872
Hello, everybody.

856
00:59:28,046 --> 00:59:33,484
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

857
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:35,813
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

858
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:42,921
- Lee?
- Hey.

859
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:45,562
What up, my brizzo?

860
00:59:46,898 --> 00:59:49,992
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

861
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:53,468
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

862
00:59:54,906 --> 00:59:56,965
What's going on, Norm?

863
00:59:57,142 --> 00:59:58,973
Something's going down on a big scale.

864
00:59:59,144 --> 01:00:03,103
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

865
01:00:03,281 --> 01:00:06,444
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

866
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:09,849
Well, we had a nice run.

867
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:12,285
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

868
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:15,616
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

869
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:17,921
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

870
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:20,530
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

871
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:23,327
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

872
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:24,763
- I was.
- I was watching you.

873
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:26,164
Yeah, you were.

874
01:00:26,337 --> 01:00:29,864
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

875
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:33,204
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

876
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:36,347
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

877
01:00:36,514 --> 01:00:38,345
You may be my last loan.

878
01:00:40,351 --> 01:00:42,080
It's a Ducati.

879
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:45,745
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

880
01:00:47,092 --> 01:00:50,584
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

881
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,226
See you on the other side, Lee.

882
01:00:58,002 --> 01:00:59,697
Carl.

883
01:01:02,073 --> 01:01:05,270
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

884
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:07,343
Pleasure to meet you.

885
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,183
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

886
01:01:19,357 --> 01:01:21,382
You have given out...

887
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,128
...561.

888
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:26,353
A little more than average, then.

889
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:28,897
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

890
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:36,306
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

891
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:38,408
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

892
01:01:38,576 --> 01:01:41,568
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

893
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:43,873
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

894
01:01:44,048 --> 01:01:46,516
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

895
01:01:46,718 --> 01:01:49,710
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

896
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,518
But...

897
01:01:59,764 --> 01:02:01,095
But then I looked closer.

898
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:04,562
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

899
01:02:04,736 --> 01:02:07,864
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

900
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:10,132
And because you've given out
so many of them...

901
01:02:10,308 --> 01:02:14,574
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

902
01:02:14,946 --> 01:02:17,005
See, Car, you worrywart.

903
01:02:17,182 --> 01:02:20,743
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

904
01:02:20,952 --> 01:02:23,182
- Corporate?
- Wow.

905
01:02:23,421 --> 01:02:25,514
That's great. I would have to say...

906
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,523
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

907
01:02:28,693 --> 01:02:30,854
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

908
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:34,931
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

909
01:02:35,433 --> 01:02:36,798
Got it. Yep.

910
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:39,937
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

911
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:42,629
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

912
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:47,301
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

913
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:55,883
This one is nice.

914
01:02:56,054 --> 01:02:58,454
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

915
01:02:58,623 --> 01:02:59,647
- I love it.
- Yeah?

916
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:01,189
Yeah.

917
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,920
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

918
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:06,825
It's the same as regular bingo...

919
01:03:06,998 --> 01:03:10,627
...but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

920
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:12,727
Yeah.

921
01:03:12,904 --> 01:03:14,804
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

922
01:03:14,973 --> 01:03:16,565
I don't want anything complicated.

923
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:19,539
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

924
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,145
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

925
01:03:22,313 --> 01:03:25,908
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

926
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:33,280
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

927
01:04:22,173 --> 01:04:23,197
Okay.

928
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:29,413
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

929
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,016
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

930
01:04:39,624 --> 01:04:40,886
What's going on?

931
01:04:42,627 --> 01:04:44,686
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

932
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:47,556
Jump.

933
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:50,657
What the hell are you looking at?

934
01:04:51,703 --> 01:04:55,230
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

935
01:04:55,406 --> 01:04:57,306
Hey, lady, move that dog.

936
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:00,469
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

937
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:02,112
Has somebody called the police?

938
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,738
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

939
01:05:05,917 --> 01:05:09,250
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

940
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:29,496
Don't do it.

941
01:05:31,609 --> 01:05:33,509
It can't be that bad.

942
01:05:35,913 --> 01:05:37,312
Hey, buddy.

943
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:39,439
Who are you, man?

944
01:05:39,617 --> 01:05:43,314
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

945
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:46,423
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

946
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:50,118
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

947
01:05:50,695 --> 01:05:52,822
I should say something to you here.

948
01:05:54,499 --> 01:05:56,057
I don't really know what it is.

949
01:05:56,234 --> 01:05:58,327
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

950
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:00,471
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

951
01:06:03,374 --> 01:06:06,309
Wait. I've got it.

952
01:06:09,247 --> 01:06:10,874
Where you going, man?

953
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:13,813
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

954
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:15,543
Oh, man.

955
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:24,792
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

956
01:06:24,962 --> 01:06:27,522
Patience is a virtue.

957
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:33,403
What the hell you doing in there?

958
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:40,237
<i>I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

959
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:46,915
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in</i>

960
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:50,680
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

961
01:06:50,855 --> 01:06:56,020
<i>I would understand</i>

962
01:06:56,194 --> 01:07:03,191
<i>I would understand</i>

963
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:05,365
Um... Oh...

964
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:06,929
What is it?

965
01:07:07,805 --> 01:07:10,433
<i>The angry boy a bit too insane</i>

966
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:13,439
<i>Icing over a secret pain</i>

967
01:07:13,611 --> 01:07:18,844
<i>You know you don't belong</i>

968
01:07:19,016 --> 01:07:23,180
<i>Everyone I know has got a reason</i>

969
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,111
<i>To say</i>

970
01:07:25,289 --> 01:07:26,779
<i>You can put the past away</i>

971
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:30,985
<i>I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

972
01:07:31,162 --> 01:07:35,895
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies
You've been living in</i>

973
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:39,764
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

974
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:44,636
<i>I would understand</i>

975
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:47,642
<i>I would understand</i>

976
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:54,381
<i>I would understand</i>

977
01:07:54,552 --> 01:07:58,545
<i>I would understand</i>

978
01:07:59,323 --> 01:08:01,723
<i>I would understand</i>

979
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:12,994
I got blisters on my fingers.

980
01:08:21,312 --> 01:08:22,904
Carl.

981
01:08:23,347 --> 01:08:25,907
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

982
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,176
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

983
01:08:28,352 --> 01:08:32,118
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

984
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:36,590
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

985
01:08:37,628 --> 01:08:41,587
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

986
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:44,860
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

987
01:08:45,036 --> 01:08:47,504
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

988
01:08:47,672 --> 01:08:49,606
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

989
01:08:49,774 --> 01:08:53,335
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

990
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:56,810
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

991
01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:01,076
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

992
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:02,947
No.

993
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:16,294
So I have some carry-on here.

994
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:20,870
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

995
01:09:21,038 --> 01:09:22,630
We've never done this before.

996
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:29,836
The next flight available for boarding...

997
01:09:30,414 --> 01:09:31,847
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

998
01:09:33,818 --> 01:09:34,842
Okay.

999
01:09:35,019 --> 01:09:36,043
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,380
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1001
01:09:37,555 --> 01:09:38,715
Here we come.

1002
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,855
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1003
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:48,055
Well, clearly we should go there.

1004
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:56,066
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1005
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,504
...weighed over 10 and a half pounds. "

1006
01:09:58,676 --> 01:10:01,474
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1007
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,448
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1008
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:07,311
Check out the phone.

1009
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:11,012
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1010
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:13,088
Hello?

1011
01:10:17,428 --> 01:10:18,895
Nice shot.

1012
01:10:20,998 --> 01:10:24,593
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1013
01:10:25,503 --> 01:10:27,403
So, what do I do? I just...

1014
01:10:29,106 --> 01:10:31,506
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1015
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:35,369
- Okay.
- You got it.

1016
01:10:35,546 --> 01:10:36,570
Pull?

1017
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:40,508
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1018
01:10:40,685 --> 01:10:43,586
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1019
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:51,527
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...</i>

1020
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:55,962
<i>...for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.</i>

1021
01:11:04,008 --> 01:11:05,976
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1022
01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:08,703
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1023
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:10,471
What, do you live here now?

1024
01:11:10,648 --> 01:11:14,277
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1025
01:11:14,452 --> 01:11:17,114
Hey. Is that Carl?

1026
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:19,415
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1027
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:26,058
<i>The energy is palpable here,
Chris. I can't even hear myself think.</i>

1028
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:29,727
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1029
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:34,930
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1030
01:11:35,106 --> 01:11:37,597
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1031
01:11:37,775 --> 01:11:40,767
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1032
01:11:40,945 --> 01:11:43,709
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1033
01:11:45,015 --> 01:11:47,210
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1034
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:54,885
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1035
01:11:56,227 --> 01:11:59,788
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1036
01:11:59,964 --> 01:12:03,559
- Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1037
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:05,599
Don't, please.

1038
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:09,703
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1039
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:13,407
Here. I have to protect you.

1040
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,167
Come on.

1041
01:12:15,346 --> 01:12:19,214
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1042
01:12:19,383 --> 01:12:21,078
Come on.

1043
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,115
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1044
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:29,020
Allison, are you okay?

1045
01:12:29,693 --> 01:12:32,992
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

1046
01:12:39,503 --> 01:12:40,834
What?

1047
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:44,464
I don't know. I think I love you.

1048
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:47,343
Really?

1049
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:52,107
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1050
01:12:52,283 --> 01:12:55,582
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1051
01:12:55,753 --> 01:12:57,482
I love you like...

1052
01:12:57,988 --> 01:13:01,287
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1053
01:13:02,092 --> 01:13:03,559
I've been thinking...

1054
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:06,218
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1055
01:13:06,397 --> 01:13:11,266
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1056
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:15,936
Wow. Really? You've been thinking that?

1057
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,067
What do you think?

1058
01:13:18,242 --> 01:13:22,679
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1059
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:24,314
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1060
01:13:24,482 --> 01:13:26,450
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1061
01:13:26,617 --> 01:13:29,245
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1062
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:33,322
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1063
01:13:34,191 --> 01:13:35,522
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1064
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:40,187
<i>Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...</i>

1065
01:13:54,979 --> 01:13:58,608
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1066
01:14:01,452 --> 01:14:04,250
I'll just be one minute.

1067
01:14:04,421 --> 01:14:07,913
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1068
01:14:08,092 --> 01:14:09,923
I'm in.

1069
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,924
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1070
01:14:15,866 --> 01:14:17,265
Sir?

1071
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:21,605
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1072
01:14:21,772 --> 01:14:24,605
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1073
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:29,974
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1074
01:14:30,147 --> 01:14:32,945
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

1075
01:14:33,117 --> 01:14:35,278
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1076
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:38,285
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1077
01:14:39,723 --> 01:14:42,055
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1078
01:14:42,226 --> 01:14:43,818
Come on, lady.

1079
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:48,828
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1080
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:53,163
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1081
01:14:53,337 --> 01:14:55,305
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1082
01:14:55,472 --> 01:14:57,463
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1083
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:59,472
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1084
01:14:59,643 --> 01:15:01,804
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1085
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:05,540
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1086
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:08,549
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

1087
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,812
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1088
01:15:10,988 --> 01:15:12,922
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1089
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:16,355
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1090
01:15:16,527 --> 01:15:20,657
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder. Com?

1091
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:23,890
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1092
01:15:24,068 --> 01:15:27,196
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1093
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:31,137
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan Officer
at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1094
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:33,833
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1095
01:15:34,011 --> 01:15:35,501
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1096
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,874
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1097
01:15:38,048 --> 01:15:40,573
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1098
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:43,151
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1099
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,880
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1100
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:48,183
- You were married?
- Yes.

1101
01:15:49,193 --> 01:15:51,354
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1102
01:15:51,528 --> 01:15:54,156
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1103
01:15:54,331 --> 01:15:57,266
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1104
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:02,429
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1105
01:16:03,741 --> 01:16:05,606
His name was Marx.

1106
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:11,543
I need to speak to my attorney.

1107
01:16:16,253 --> 01:16:19,381
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1108
01:16:19,556 --> 01:16:24,391
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1109
01:16:24,561 --> 01:16:26,654
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1110
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,924
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1111
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,830
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1112
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:36,335
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1113
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:38,407
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1114
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:40,167
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1115
01:16:40,344 --> 01:16:43,404
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

1116
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:46,549
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1117
01:16:49,353 --> 01:16:52,516
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1118
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,658
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1119
01:16:54,825 --> 01:16:57,692
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1120
01:16:58,228 --> 01:17:00,253
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1121
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:04,162
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's excellent.

1122
01:17:04,334 --> 01:17:06,063
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1123
01:17:06,236 --> 01:17:09,603
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1124
01:17:09,773 --> 01:17:11,604
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1125
01:17:11,775 --> 01:17:13,766
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1126
01:17:13,944 --> 01:17:16,378
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1127
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:19,175
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1128
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:21,681
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1129
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:23,046
You paused.

1130
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,882
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1131
01:17:26,056 --> 01:17:30,186
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1132
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,524
...was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1133
01:17:42,172 --> 01:17:43,434
Allison.

1134
01:17:45,142 --> 01:17:46,609
Bye, Carl.

1135
01:18:00,858 --> 01:18:04,419
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1136
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:06,787
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1137
01:18:06,964 --> 01:18:10,161
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1138
01:18:10,334 --> 01:18:12,325
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1139
01:18:12,503 --> 01:18:15,472
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1140
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:17,266
Ever think things got screwed up...

1141
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:21,309
...because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1142
01:18:21,478 --> 01:18:23,446
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1143
01:18:23,614 --> 01:18:26,082
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1144
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,811
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1145
01:18:29,987 --> 01:18:31,454
...a. k. a. What normal people do.

1146
01:18:31,622 --> 01:18:34,386
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1147
01:18:34,558 --> 01:18:35,684
Or not.

1148
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:37,759
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

1149
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:39,418
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1150
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:41,561
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1151
01:18:43,534 --> 01:18:44,933
Carl.

1152
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:50,273
Bye, Carl.

1153
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:53,975
<i>- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.</i>

1154
01:18:54,144 --> 01:18:55,975
<i>- Do you?
- Uh-huh.</i>

1155
01:18:56,146 --> 01:18:58,080
<i>You know you and I are a lot alike?</i>

1156
01:18:59,316 --> 01:19:01,648
<i>My mother likes good food.</i>

1157
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:05,147
<i>She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...</i>

1158
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:07,256
<i>...than bad food any old day
of the week. "</i>

1159
01:19:07,424 --> 01:19:08,982
Hey.

1160
01:19:09,293 --> 01:19:11,158
It's me again.

1161
01:19:11,328 --> 01:19:13,796
Specifically I'm talking about 15
to 20 percent.

1162
01:19:13,964 --> 01:19:16,933
<i>The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...</i>

1163
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:35,648
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1164
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,182
You're officially flying by yourself.

1165
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:42,247
Cool.

1166
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:45,719
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

1167
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:54,427
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1168
01:19:54,605 --> 01:19:56,436
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1169
01:19:56,607 --> 01:19:59,735
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1170
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:03,573
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

1171
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:17,321
Ah!

1172
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:36,172
Allison?

1173
01:20:36,346 --> 01:20:40,476
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1174
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:45,714
<i>- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.</i>

1175
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:47,720
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1176
01:20:47,891 --> 01:20:50,291
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1177
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,191
<i>- I never really thought of them as...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.</i>

1178
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,694
Wes? Can you hear me?

1179
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,132
<i>Go get the ball!</i>

1180
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:04,741
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

1181
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:08,810
...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1182
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:10,713
Which ones?

1183
01:21:12,382 --> 01:21:15,010
We are Sparta!

1184
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:20,188
Hi, Norm.

1185
01:21:43,413 --> 01:21:45,711
<i>You have three messages.</i>

1186
01:21:45,882 --> 01:21:48,612
<i>Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.</i>

1187
01:21:48,785 --> 01:21:51,652
<i>No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.</i>

1188
01:21:51,822 --> 01:21:54,882
<i>I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.</i>

1189
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:58,090
<i>Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.</i>

1190
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:00,821
<i>You might notice the front bumper missing.
Not to worry.</i>

1191
01:22:00,998 --> 01:22:03,762
<i>I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.</i>

1192
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:08,303
<i>And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.</i>

1193
01:22:08,905 --> 01:22:11,931
<i>It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...</i>

1194
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:15,875
<i>...but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.</i>

1195
01:22:16,046 --> 01:22:19,174
<i>Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.</i>

1196
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:22,011
<i>- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.</i>

1197
01:22:22,185 --> 01:22:24,153
<i>Right? Call me.</i>

1198
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:37,690
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1199
01:22:37,868 --> 01:22:40,428
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1200
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:41,866
What?

1201
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:44,701
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

1202
01:22:49,946 --> 01:22:52,210
Surprise!

1203
01:22:52,382 --> 01:22:54,976
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1204
01:22:55,152 --> 01:22:56,619
How did you pull this off?

1205
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:59,449
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1206
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,488
I like it, I like it.

1207
01:23:02,659 --> 01:23:04,092
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1208
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:06,354
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1209
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,691
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1210
01:23:09,166 --> 01:23:11,999
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1211
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:14,660
On him, on him.

1212
01:23:17,674 --> 01:23:18,698
Cake?

1213
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:19,899
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1214
01:23:20,077 --> 01:23:24,480
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1215
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:29,041
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1216
01:23:35,492 --> 01:23:39,485
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1217
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:42,496
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1218
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:45,533
You know, taking her day by day.

1219
01:23:45,702 --> 01:23:48,535
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1220
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:50,065
Oh.

1221
01:23:54,478 --> 01:23:58,915
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1222
01:24:00,784 --> 01:24:05,153
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1223
01:24:05,322 --> 01:24:06,346
Do you dance?

1224
01:24:06,923 --> 01:24:09,414
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1225
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:13,154
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1226
01:24:39,422 --> 01:24:45,054
<i>- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...</i>

1227
01:24:49,366 --> 01:24:51,231
Oh, jeez.

1228
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:55,134
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1229
01:24:55,305 --> 01:24:57,273
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,534
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1231
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:03,235
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1232
01:25:03,413 --> 01:25:07,474
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1233
01:25:07,651 --> 01:25:09,243
I know it sounds silly...

1234
01:25:09,419 --> 01:25:11,979
...but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1235
01:25:12,155 --> 01:25:16,455
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1236
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,755
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1237
01:25:18,929 --> 01:25:21,921
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1238
01:25:22,098 --> 01:25:24,726
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1239
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:28,399
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:25:28,572 --> 01:25:31,040
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1241
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:33,176
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1242
01:25:38,648 --> 01:25:40,548
Hi there.

1243
01:25:41,484 --> 01:25:43,111
Hello there.

1244
01:25:43,887 --> 01:25:46,856
You must be Tillie.

1245
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:52,885
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1246
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:02,497
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1247
01:26:03,907 --> 01:26:05,636
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:26:15,485 --> 01:26:18,045
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1249
01:26:18,688 --> 01:26:24,558
<i>- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?</i>

1250
01:26:24,728 --> 01:26:27,595
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1251
01:26:27,764 --> 01:26:31,632
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1252
01:26:31,801 --> 01:26:33,530
I don't know.

1253
01:26:34,437 --> 01:26:38,430
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1254
01:26:39,776 --> 01:26:42,244
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1255
01:26:42,412 --> 01:26:46,678
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1256
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:51,184
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1257
01:26:51,354 --> 01:26:57,623
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well...</i>

1258
01:26:57,794 --> 01:27:00,763
<i>- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...</i>

1259
01:27:05,602 --> 01:27:07,331
Steph...

1260
01:27:08,004 --> 01:27:09,835
...I can't.

1261
01:27:10,473 --> 01:27:12,168
I'm sorry.

1262
01:27:14,678 --> 01:27:16,612
What are you saying?

1263
01:27:18,248 --> 01:27:20,443
I'm saying no.

1264
01:27:36,933 --> 01:27:38,400
Are you serious?

1265
01:27:52,782 --> 01:27:53,942
Oh, Jesus.

1266
01:28:01,424 --> 01:28:03,949
Oh, please.

1267
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:08,090
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1268
01:28:08,264 --> 01:28:12,325
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1269
01:28:12,502 --> 01:28:16,336
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1270
01:28:16,506 --> 01:28:20,704
<i>- No man, no man, no man...
- Not possible!</i>

1271
01:28:22,946 --> 01:28:25,073
Jackoff.

1272
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:31,678
<i>Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes. "</i>

1273
01:28:31,855 --> 01:28:34,483
<i>Guess, mess.</i>

1274
01:28:34,657 --> 01:28:40,687
<i>Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.</i>

1275
01:28:40,864 --> 01:28:42,832
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1276
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:10,254
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1277
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:15,358
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman. "

1278
01:29:15,532 --> 01:29:19,093
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

1279
01:29:19,369 --> 01:29:21,303
Peter.

1280
01:29:22,038 --> 01:29:23,699
A covenant.

1281
01:29:23,873 --> 01:29:26,171
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1282
01:29:26,776 --> 01:29:29,745
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1283
01:29:30,613 --> 01:29:33,446
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1284
01:29:33,616 --> 01:29:35,083
It is nonsense.

1285
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,412
It's him.

1286
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:44,222
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1287
01:29:44,394 --> 01:29:47,192
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

1288
01:29:47,363 --> 01:29:49,797
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1289
01:29:49,966 --> 01:29:53,800
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1290
01:29:54,838 --> 01:29:57,068
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1291
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:00,903
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1292
01:30:01,077 --> 01:30:04,046
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1293
01:30:04,214 --> 01:30:06,307
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

1294
01:30:06,483 --> 01:30:09,384
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1295
01:30:09,552 --> 01:30:11,520
No, that's not the point.

1296
01:30:11,688 --> 01:30:15,488
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

1297
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:17,285
...to get you started.

1298
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:20,088
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1299
01:30:20,263 --> 01:30:22,697
...not because a covenant tells you to...

1300
01:30:22,866 --> 01:30:25,801
...but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1301
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,731
Yeah.

1302
01:30:29,305 --> 01:30:31,034
You're right.

1303
01:30:31,774 --> 01:30:34,675
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1304
01:30:34,844 --> 01:30:36,243
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1305
01:30:36,412 --> 01:30:38,972
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1306
01:30:39,582 --> 01:30:43,643
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1307
01:30:44,454 --> 01:30:48,322
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1308
01:30:48,491 --> 01:30:49,753
Perfect.

1309
01:30:52,562 --> 01:30:54,325
I said that.

1310
01:30:54,531 --> 01:30:56,158
Whatever.

1311
01:30:58,001 --> 01:31:01,562
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1312
01:31:05,842 --> 01:31:08,310
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1313
01:31:08,478 --> 01:31:10,810
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1314
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:17,342
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1315
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,889
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1316
01:31:22,058 --> 01:31:26,495
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1317
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:29,257
Ducati.

1318
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:37,639
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1319
01:31:37,807 --> 01:31:41,004
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1320
01:31:41,177 --> 01:31:43,509
No, Carl,
this is not the same.

1321
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,672
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1322
01:31:47,684 --> 01:31:49,652
Holy Jesus.

1323
01:31:49,819 --> 01:31:51,081
- Torque.

1324
01:32:03,499 --> 01:32:05,558
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1325
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:08,665
Ah!

1326
01:32:09,172 --> 01:32:11,003
You might wanna get out of the way.

1327
01:32:22,285 --> 01:32:24,685
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1328
01:32:27,757 --> 01:32:28,815
Ah!

1329
01:32:32,695 --> 01:32:34,094
Whoa!

1330
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:20,304
What an asshole.

1331
01:33:36,526 --> 01:33:38,084
Carl, what are you doing here?

1332
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:42,163
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1333
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:45,425
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1334
01:33:45,601 --> 01:33:48,092
Okay, people, let's go.

1335
01:33:51,641 --> 01:33:52,733
But I wanna be with you.

1336
01:33:52,909 --> 01:33:55,104
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1337
01:33:55,278 --> 01:33:57,838
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1338
01:33:58,014 --> 01:34:00,346
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1339
01:34:00,516 --> 01:34:03,110
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking.

1340
01:34:03,286 --> 01:34:07,245
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1341
01:34:07,423 --> 01:34:10,392
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1342
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,085
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1343
01:34:13,262 --> 01:34:15,253
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1344
01:34:15,431 --> 01:34:19,197
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

1345
01:34:19,368 --> 01:34:22,337
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1346
01:34:22,505 --> 01:34:25,599
Because the old Carl
didn't think he was enough for anybody.

1347
01:34:25,775 --> 01:34:28,801
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1348
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:31,310
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1349
01:34:31,848 --> 01:34:34,316
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1350
01:34:34,484 --> 01:34:37,749
But now I know that what I have to share
is pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1351
01:34:39,088 --> 01:34:41,215
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1352
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:43,415
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1353
01:34:44,026 --> 01:34:46,494
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1354
01:34:46,662 --> 01:34:49,995
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1355
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:53,226
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1356
01:34:53,402 --> 01:34:55,336
You weren't scared of anything.

1357
01:34:55,505 --> 01:34:58,167
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1358
01:34:58,341 --> 01:35:01,504
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1359
01:35:02,111 --> 01:35:04,102
And I'm scared too.

1360
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,339
So let's be scared together.

1361
01:35:08,284 --> 01:35:10,275
I don't know what you want me to say.

1362
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,387
So just say yes...

1363
01:35:12,922 --> 01:35:15,356
...but only if you really want to.

1364
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:18,719
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1365
01:35:20,029 --> 01:35:21,860
Yeah, I noticed that.

1366
01:35:22,398 --> 01:35:23,763
Well?

1367
01:35:30,573 --> 01:35:32,803
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1368
01:35:33,676 --> 01:35:37,271
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1369
01:35:44,253 --> 01:35:45,914
I like maybe.

1370
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:47,282
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1371
01:36:14,217 --> 01:36:17,675
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1372
01:36:17,854 --> 01:36:20,015
You got anything with a flat front?

1373
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:22,123
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1374
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,193
Thanks, guys.

1375
01:36:26,362 --> 01:36:28,956
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

1376
01:36:29,131 --> 01:36:31,691
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1377
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:33,233
You're a good man, Carl.

1378
01:36:33,402 --> 01:36:37,930
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1379
01:36:39,408 --> 01:36:44,744
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1380
01:36:44,914 --> 01:36:49,351
And the word
you will have said 2 million times is:

1381
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:51,850
Yes!

1382
01:36:57,326 --> 01:36:59,487
Good God.

1383
01:38:33,589 --> 01:38:35,716
So anything else
we need to know?

1384
01:38:35,891 --> 01:38:40,157
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1385
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:41,887
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1386
01:38:42,064 --> 01:38:43,429
Right.

1387
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,031
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1388
01:38:46,202 --> 01:38:48,898
I never could have finished the suits
without it.

1389
01:38:50,606 --> 01:38:54,133
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1390
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:55,334
What?

1391
01:38:55,511 --> 01:38:58,446
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1392
01:38:58,614 --> 01:39:00,275
What if I'm
one of those chickens...

1393
01:39:00,449 --> 01:39:03,748
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1394
01:39:03,919 --> 01:39:06,854
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1395
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:10,582
I told you,
my foot caught a nail.

1396
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:11,988
Hiyah!

1397
01:39:58,841 --> 01:40:00,365
I love this.
