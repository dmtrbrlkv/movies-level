1
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,985
This is a story of boy meets girl.

2
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,743
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,

3
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,662
grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy...

4
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:20,873
until the day he met "the one."

5
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:26,007
This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music...

6
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:28,672
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

7
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,091
Elaine! Elaine!

8
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:34,178
The girl, Summer Finn
of Shinnecock, Michigan

9
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,513
did not share this belief.

10
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:40,142
Since the disintegration
of her parents marriage

11
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,478
she'd only loved two things.

12
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:45,689
The first was her long dark hair.

13
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:48,859
The second was how easily
she could cut it off...

14
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,903
and feel nothing.

15
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,282
Tom meets Summer on January 8.

16
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:59,620
He knows almost immediately
she's who he's been searching for.

17
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:04,166
This is a story of boy meets girl.

18
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,294
But you should know up front

19
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,379
this is not a love story.

We didn't know who else to call.

36
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,472
It's Amanda Heller
all over again.

37
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,515
You did the right thing.

38
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:30,520
Now where is he?

39
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,278
Thomas.

40
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,282
Rachel.
What are you doing here?

41
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,868
I'm here to help you.
- Help me how?

42
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:47,204
First' put down the plate.

43
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,666
Drink this.

44
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,127
- What is that?
- Vodka.

45
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,421
Um' does Mom know
that you're here?

46
00:04:56,547 --> 00:05:00,008
'Cause it's probably past 10:00.
- Don't worry about it.

47
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:04,763
Just start from the beginning,
and tell us what happened.

48
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,516
Things were going so well.

49
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,613
Then what?

50
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,824
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

51
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,076
Just like that?
- Just like that.

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,997
- Did she say why?
- I mean' this thing-what are we doing?

53
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,165
I mean, is this normal?

54
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,210
Norm-I-I don't know. I don't care.
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?

55
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,004
You're happy?
- You're not?

56
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,923
All we do is argue.
- That is bullshit.

57
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,591
Maybe she was just
in a bad mood.

58
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,677
Yeah, maybe like
a-a hormonal thing.

59
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,388
- P.M.S?
- What do you know about P.M.S?

60
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:49,808
- More than you' Tom.
- Then what happened?

61
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,893
This can't come as
a total surprise to you.

62
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,396
I mean, we've been
like Sid and Nancy
for months now.

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,358
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy...
seven times with a kitchen knife.

64
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:03,739
I- I mean, we have some disagreements,
but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.

65
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,908
No. I'm Sid.

66
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,244
Oh, so I'm Nancy?

67
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,877
Let's just eat,
and we'll talk about it later.

68
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,713
Mmm. That is good.

69
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,382
I'm really glad we did this.

70
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,593
I love these pancakes.

71
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,430
What?

72
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:32,142
Tom, don't go.
You're still my best friend!

73
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,896
- Jesus.
- You've broken up with girls before.

74
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,564
Yes.

75
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,399
And girls have broken up
with you before.

76
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,692
This is different.
- Why?

77
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:41,818
'Cause it's Summer.

78
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:44,696
So you'll-you'll
meet somebody new.

79
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,783
Point is, you're
the best guy I know.
You'll get over her.

80
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,535
I think it's kind of like how they say.
There's, uh-

81
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,537
There's plenty of other
fish in the sea.

82
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,082
No.
- They-They say that.

83
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,167
Well, they're lying.

84
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,837
I don't want to get over her.

85
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:04,341
I want to get her back.

86
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,928
Maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach.

87
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,930
The nuclear family is dead'

88
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,724
and we need a new holiday
that recognizes that.

89
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,810
May 21st.

90
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,397
Other Mother's Day.

91
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,984
Thank you.

92
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,446
I'd say we've got
some potential here.
What do you think, Hansen?

93
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,366
Could you write up some
prototypes for these?

94
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,119
Uh' Mr. Vance,
there's a telephone call
for you on line three.

95
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:36,832
Oh. Thank you.
Uh' everyone, this is Summer,
my new assistant.

96
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,167
Summer just moved here from-

97
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,753
Michigan.
- Right. Michigan. Right.

98
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:44,131
Uh, Summer, everyone.

99
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:47,300
Everyone, Summer.
Excuse me. I have to take this.

100
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,179
It's nice to meet you all.

101
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:55,142
There's only two kinds
of people in the world.

102
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,352
There's women, and there's men.

103
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,648
Summer Finn was a woman.

104
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,402
Height, average. Weight, average.

105
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,488
Shoe size, slightly above average.

106
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,574
For all intents and purposes,

107
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,702
Summer Finn, just another girl.

108
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,704
Except she wasn't.

109
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:18,248
To wit, in 1998,

110
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,251
Summer quoted a song
by the Scottish band
Belle and Sebastian...

111
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,253
in her high school yearbook.

112
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,964
"Color my life
with the chaos of trouble."

113
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,924
This spike in Michigan
sales of their album...

114
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,177
The Boy with the Arab Strap...

115
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,679
continues to puzzle industry analysts.

116
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,683
Summer's employment
at the Daily Freeze
during her sophomore year...

117
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,687
coincided with an inexplicable
212% increase in revenue.

118
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,024
Every apartment Summer rented...

119
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:48,904
was offered at an average rate
of 9.2% below market value.

120
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,489
And her round-trip commute to work...

121
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:55,076
averaged 18.4 double takes per day.

122
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,913
It was a rare quality,
this "Summer effect."

123
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:02,000
Rare, and yet something
every postadoles cent male
has encountered...

124
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,002
at least once in their lives.

125
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,173
For Tom Hans en to find it now
in a city of 400,000 offices,

126
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,719
91,000 commercial buildings
and 3.8 million people-

127
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,056
Well, that could only
be explained by one thing:

128
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,099
fate.

129
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,855
Dude, I hear she's a bitch.

130
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,690
Really?

131
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,855
Yeah. Patel tried to talk
to her in the copy room.
She's totally not having it.

132
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,528
Maybe she was just in a hurry.

133
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,365
And maybe she's an uppity,
"better than everyone" superskank.

134
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,703
Damn.
I know.
She's pretty hot.

135
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,830
That sucks.
Why is it pretty girls...

136
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,333
think they can treat people like crap
and get away with it?

137
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,502
Centuries of reinforcement.

138
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,089
You know what? Screw her.
I don't care.

139
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,591
If she wants to be that way, fine.

140
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,943

00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,826
Hi.

144
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,831
I love the Smiths.
Sorry?

145
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,874
I said I love the Smiths.

You have-You have
good taste in music.

147
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,632
You like the Smiths?
- Yeah.

Ah.

I don't know what it is.
- Sure.

160
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,428
So, how's it goin'?

161
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,472
Pretty good.
You just moved here, right?

162
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,806
Mm-hmm.
- When?

163
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,601
Saturday.
- Oh, wow.

164
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,103
And, uh, what brought you?

165
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,565
Boredom mostly.

166
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,193
Wanted to try something
new and exciting.
- Mmm.

167
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,071
Well, clearly you've
come to the right place.

168
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,243
So, have you
worked here long?
- About three or four years.

169
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:45,330
Wow. You've...

170
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,624
always wanted to write
greeting cards?

171
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,626
No, I don't even
want to do it now.

172
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,961
Well, you should
do something else then.

173
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:55,256
Yeah. I studied to be
an architect, actually.

174
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:58,343
You did? That's cool.
What happened there?

175
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,513
It didn't work out.

176
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,474
I needed a job, and here we are.

177
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,142
You any good?

178
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,604
Well, um, I wrote this one.

179
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,609
"Today you're a man.

180
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,569
Mazel tov
on your bar mitzvah."

181
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,531
It's a big seller.
I meant as an architect.

182
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,117
Yeah.

183
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,327
I doubt it.
- Well,

184
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:27,372
you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer.

185
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,166
Thank you. That was actually
my nickname in college.

186
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,168
They called me
"Perfectly Adequate" Hansen.

187
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,170
They used to call me Anal Girl.

188
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:41,177
I was very neat and organized.

189
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:47,475
Well, I should get back, so-Uh-

190
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,644
All right. See you later.

191
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:39,319
I don't know, man.
I think it's official.

192
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,572
I'm in love with Summer.
I love her smile.

193
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,867
I love her hair. I love her knees.

194
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,203
I love this heart-shaped birthmark
she has on her neck.

195
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,789
I love the way she sometimes
licks her lips before she talks.

196
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,584
I love the sound of her laugh.

197
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,753
I love the way she looks
when she's sleeping.

198
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>♪ She's like the wind ♪</i>

199
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,635
I love how I hear this song
every-every time I think of her.

200
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,095
I love how she makes me feel.

201
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,097
Like-

202
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,309
Like anything's possible,
or like-I don't know. Like-

203
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,812
Like life is worth it.

204
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,318
This is not good.

205
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,448
She likes Magritte and Hopper.

206
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,034
And we talked
about Bananafish
for like 20 minutes.

207
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,078
We're so compatible,
it's insane.

208
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,456
She's-well, she's not
like I thought at all.
She's amazing.

209
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,084
Oh, boy.
- What?

210
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:40,922
Just 'cause some
cute girl likes the same
bizarro crap you do,

211
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,007
that doesn't make her
your soul mate, Tom.

212
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,969
- Red team wins!
- What do you mean?

213
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,430
- It's off.
- What?

214
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,432
- Me and Summer.
- Was it ever on?

215
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,686
No, but it could have been,
in a world where
good things happen to me.

216
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,896
- Yeah, well, that's not
really where we live.
- No.

217
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,107
Lucky.

218
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,693
So, what happened?

219
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,736
All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

220
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,781
So there we are.
Nine more floors to ride,
just me and her.

221
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,866
Hey, Summer.

222
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,952
Hi.

223
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,455
How was your weekend?

224
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,457
It was good.

225
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,293
Can you believe that shit?

226
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,378
I'm sorry. what shit?

227
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,299
- I think I missed something.
- She said, "It was good."
Emphasis on the "good."

228
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,885
She basically said she spent
the weekend having sex with
some guy she met at the gym.

229
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,054
Skank. Whatever.
I'm over it.

230
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,974
What the hell
is wrong with you?
- She's not interested in me.

231
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,934
There's really nothing
I can do about that.

232
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,395
Just because
she said it was good?
And some other things.

233
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,689
Like, did she say, uh,
"hey" instead of "hi"?

234
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,735
I mean, 'cause you know
that that-that means
that she's a lesbian, right?

235
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,903
I gave her plenty of chances.

236
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,657
I'm going to the supply room.
Do you guys need anything?

237
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:52,410
I think you know what I need.

238
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,041
Uh, toner.

239
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,168
Okay. Sure. No problem.

I'm unhassled.

248

but loneliness-

00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,258
- It's underrated.

00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:03,147
This Friday, all you can
karaoke at the Mill.
- No.

253
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,359
Come on.
They're not gonna let you
back in there after last time.

254
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,611
Ah, I wasn't that bad.

255
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:11,698
Dude, you threw up
on the stage, you tried to
fight the bartender...

256
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,658
and you threatened to
burn the place down.

257
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,536
But I didn't
burn the place down.
- We're not going back there, man.

258
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,206
Look. It's not like that, okay?
It's a work thing.
The whole office is going.

259
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,792
I can't go, even if I wanted-
You're not listening to me.

260
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,295
What?
- The whole office is going.

Hello.
- Hi.

283
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,799
I didn't, uh-I didn't know
you were gonna join us.

284
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,051
I would have gotten you,
you know, a drink, or-

285
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,053
I'm good.
- You're good?

286
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,223
You-You were great-
great up, uh, singing.
- Thank you.

287
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,600
I wanted to sing "Born To Run,"
but they didn't have it.

288
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,644
I love "Born To Run."
- Me too.

289
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,104
Tom's from New Jersey.
- Really?

290
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,982
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was 12.

291
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,901
I named my cat
after Springsteen.

292
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,903
No kidding.
What-what was his name?

293
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,947
Bruce.

294
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,573
Oh.
That makes sense.

295
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,245
So, do you have a boyfriend?

296
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,247
- No.
- Why not?

297
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,750
- 'Cause I don't want one.
- Come on. I don't believe that.

298
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,795
You don't believe
that a woman could enjoy
being free and independent?

299
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,839
Are you a lesbian?

300
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,049
No, I'm not a lesbian.

301
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,343
I just don't feel comfortable
being anyone's girlfriend.

302
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:41,055
I don't actually feel
comfortable being anyone's
anything, you know.

303
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,599
- I don't know what
you're talking about.
- Really?

304
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,685
Nope.

305
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,770
Okay. Let me
break it down for you.

306
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:52,024
- Break it down.
- Okay. I like being on my own.

307
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,152
Relationships are messy,
and people's feelings get hurt.

308
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,405
Who needs it? We're young.

309
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,949
We live in one of
the most beautiful
cities in the world.

310
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,285
Might as well have fun
while we can and...

311
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,704
save the serious stuff for later.

312
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:08,040
Holy shit. You're a dude.
She's a dude.

313
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,169
Okay. But wait, wait.
What happens if you fall in love?

314
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,213
What?

315
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,257
Well, you don't
believe that, do you?

316
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,634
It's love.
It's not Santa Claus.

317
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,636
Well, what does
that word even mean?

318
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,764
I've been in relationships,
and I don't think I've ever seen it.

319
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:27,018
Well, maybe that's-
- And most marriages end
in divorce these days.

320
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,395
Like my parents.
- Okay. Mine too, but-

321
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,189
Me thinks the lady
doth protest too much.

322
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,484
The lady dothn't.

323
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,613
There's no such thing as love.
It's a fantasy.

324
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,324
Well, I think you're wrong.

325
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,494
Okay. Well,

326
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,122
what is it that
I'm missing then?

327
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,627
I think you know it
when you feel it.

328
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,341
I guess we can just
agree to disagree.

329
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,762
Yeah.

330
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,473
Okay. Who's singing next?

331
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,267
I nominate young Werther here.

332
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,478
I'm not nearly
drunk enough to-
Bartender.

Knight Rider? Come on.

You're amazing.

359
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,360
This was so much fun.
- Yeah.

360
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,654
You guys are so much-
- Wait! wait! Hey.

361
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,073
What's up?
- Not you.

362
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,117
You.

363
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,827
He likes you.
- Okay.

364
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,829
He likes likes you!
- Good night, McKenzie.

365
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,831
Why don't you just
tell her, Tom?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,667
You guys are the best!
Sorry you had to see that. He's-

367
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,961
Happens every time we come here.
He, uh-I don't know.

368
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,921
Something about
that guy and singing.

369
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,049
Is that true?
- Yeah, yeah.

370
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,177
He drinks, and he sings
and just loses his shit.

371
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,387
No, uh, not McKenzie.

372
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,473
Um, the other thing.

373
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,475
What thing?

374
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,561
Do you... like me?

375
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,900
Yeah.

376
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,985
Yeah, of course I like you.

377
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,946
As friends?

378
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,033
Right. As friends.

379
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,994
Just as friends?

380
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,499
Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about, um-

381
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,876
Yes. why?

382
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,254
No reason. I just-

383
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:46,842
I think you're interesting,
and I'd like for us to be friends.

384
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,011
Is that all right?

385
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,724
Yeah. It's, um-

386
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,894
Yeah. You and me.
We should be friends.
- Mmm.

387
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,979
Okay. Good.

388
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:11,033
Well, I'm that way, so-

389
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,122
Okay. Well, good night.
- Good night.

390
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,101
- Hey.
- Hi.

391
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,590
So, that was fun
the other night.

392
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,881
You son of a bitch.
- Shh!

393
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,986
The same girl you've been
obsessing over for weeks now?
I've not been obsessing.

394
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,614
The girl you said was out
of your league, that you'd
never have a chance with.

395
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:55,758
That girl.
- Paul, seriously.

396
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,264
Did you bang her?
- No.

397
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,142
What, hum job? Hand job?
- Man, no.

398
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:04,730
No jobs. I'm still unemployed.
We-We kissed.

399
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,566
Level with me, man. Come on.
This is your best friend, huh?

400
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,111
Your best friend who tolerated
you whining about this girl
for weeks on end.

401
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,381
Paul-
- You were essentially
stalking her!

402
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,156
Paul! Shh!

403
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,746
- Hi.
- Hey.

404
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,123
I'm Summer.
- Summer.

405
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,502
I'm Paul.
- Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.

406
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:34,260
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta do some, you know.

407
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:37,388
Yeah, man.
- Um, pretend I was never here.

408
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,224
Oh, wait! Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Um, if any jobs come up-

409
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,643
Thanks, Paul! See ya!

410
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,276
He's, uh, you know,
an old friend.

411
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,569
If you heard any of, um-

412
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,072
Heard what?
- Nothing. You wanna go?

413
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,825
Yeah. I'm stalking.
I mean, I'm starving.

414
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,665
Ah, hon?

415
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,709
Our sink is broken.

416
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:14,383
Man, all of our sinks
are broken.

417
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,726
What are we looking for again?

418
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,978
Uh, trivets.
How 'bout a fly gel?

419
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,105
No, I don't think so.

420
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:31,191
No? You don't
want a fly gel?

421
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,277
Home sweet home.

422
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:39,366
Our place really
is lovely, isn't it?

423
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,368
Yes.

424
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,579
Ooh! Idol's on.

425
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,630
The TV's not working.

426
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,966
Oh.

427
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:59,762
Well, I'm famished.

428
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,764
Let's eat.

429
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,854
Mmm. Smells delicious.

430
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,941
Oh, honey, that's because
it is delicious.

431
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,070
I made it myself.

432
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,447
Bald eagle.
Your favorite.

433
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,949
Mm-hmm.

434
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,624
The sink's broken.

435
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,834
Well, that's okay, because...

436
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,506
that's why we bought a home
with two kitchens.

437
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,883
You're so smart.

438
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,302
I'll race you to the bedroom.

Darling, I don't know
how to tell you this,

444
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,372
but... there's a Chinese family
in our bathroom.

445
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,809

I just wanna tell you that, um,

450
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,535
I'm not really looking...

451
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,247
for anything... serious.

452
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,711
Is that okay?

453
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,713
Yeah.

454
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:02,926
'Cause some people
kind of freak out
when they hear that.

455
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,512
No, not me.

456
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,973
You sure?

457
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,977
Yeah. Like, casual.
- Right? Take it slow.

458
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,021
Right.

459
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,106
No pressure.

460
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,808
Can you, uh-
Can you wait one second?

461
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:03,195
Okay. Settle.
She's just a girl.

462
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,239
Just a girl.

463
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,950
She wants to keep it casual,

464
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,536
which is why she's
in my bed right now.

465
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,247
But that's casual.
That's what casual people do.

466
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,125
That's fine. That's great.

467
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,467
Hi.

You know, I'm gonna-I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get Alfredo's number.

506
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:42,854
Okay.
- And I'll- And I'll bring it to you.

507
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:43,939
Okay.
- Okay?

508
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,148
Is this Solitaire?

509
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:47,818
So, did you get her back
yet or what?

510
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,572
Working on it.

511
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,954
Hey, maybe you should
write a book.
- What?

512
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,832
Well, you know, Henry Miller
said the best way
to get over a woman...

513
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,875
is to turn her into literature.

514
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,795
Well, that guy had
a lot more sex than me.

515
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:13,260
Oh, this is it! This is it!

516
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,345
So great to hear from you.

517
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,389
I can't this week, but maybe next?

518
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,599
I hope this means
you're ready to be friends.

519
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,035
Yeah, that's it. That is it.

520
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,580
Your girl is losing it.

521
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,166
Can you just be serious,
for just a second?

522
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,452
I am being totally serious.
- No, you're joking around.

523
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,129
No, I am not joking around.
"Octopus's Garden"?

524
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,840
Yes, "Octopus's Garden"
is the best Beatles song
ever recorded.

525
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,717
Why don't you just say "Piggies"?

526
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,802
Come on. I love Ringo Starr!

527
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:59,598
Nobody loves Ringo Starr.
- That's what I love about him.

528
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,852
No, no.

529
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:09,024
Ooh, this looks good.

530
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,401
Gets really good reviews.

531
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:19,117
You know what?
That looks pretty doable.

532
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:22,120
Why are you asking me now?
- Because this was your idea.

533
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,166
Put your hand there.
- Wait one second.

534
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:30,420
Okay. Three, two, one!
- One.

535
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,219
Yeah, the street level
isn't so exciting, but-

536
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:41,932
Like, if you look up
<i>-♪ Sweet ♪</i>

00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,423
This is your favorite spot?

544
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:17,801
Right here.

545
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,804
How come?

546
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,015
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain,
I guess.

547
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,852
Well, try.

548
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,688
Um-Well, okay.

549
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:33,567
Like, that building-that's, uh-

550
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,361
That's been there since 1911.

551
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,573
And that-that's the Continental.
That's L.A.'s first skyscraper.

552
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:42,033
It was built in 1904.

553
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:43,827
What is that?

554
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,912
That?

555
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:49,082
That's a parking lot.
- Oh!

556
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,627
Yeah. That's-
That's also a parking lot.

557
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,381
That's, um-Yeah.

558
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,009
There's a lot of beautiful
stuff here too though.

559
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:06,141
I don't know.
I just... wish people
would notice it more.

560
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:10,145
If it were me, then, uh-

561
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,564
If it were you what?

562
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:15,734
I don't know. I think
I'd... make 'em notice.

563
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,070
How would you make them notice?

564
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,160
I don't know.
There's a lot of different
stuff you could do.

565
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,704
Show me.

566
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,416
Please. I don't know
anything about architecture.

567
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:34,252
You want me to
draw you something?
- Yeah.

568
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:37,797
I don't have any paper.
- Well, use my arm.

569
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,968
Please, I need a tattoo.

570
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:45,680
Well, let's see your arm.
- That's the spirit.

571
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:52,270
Well, the buildings need
to be integrated better, so-

572
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:55,273
You could maximize
light capacity here.

573
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,675
It's kind of messy.

574
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,760
That's okay.

575
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:39,818
For Tom Hansen, this was the night
where everything changed.

576
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:43,238
That wall Summer
so often hid behind-

577
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,908
the wall of distance, of space, of casual-

578
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,162
that wall was slowly coming down.

579
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,958
For here was Tom, in her world,

580
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:59,462
a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.

581
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,798
And here was Summer,
wanting him there.

582
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,634
Him, no one else.

583
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,886
Have you ever been
in a tornado?
- No.

584
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:10,765
It's that and
my teeth falling out.

585
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,767
I have that too!
- You do?

586
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:16,229
Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

587
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,065
What else do you have?

588
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,192
Um, earthquakes?

589
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,528
Really?
- No.

590
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:31,244
You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.

591
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,330
It starts out like I'm running
really, really fast.

592
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,332
I'm, like, superhuman.

593
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:39,711
And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.

594
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,590
And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even
touching the ground.

595
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:48,303
And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing,
amazing realness.

596
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,140
I'm free. I'm safe.

597
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,060
Then I realize,

598
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,812
I'm completely alone.

599
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,234
And then I wake up.

600
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,320
As he listened, Tom began to realize...

601
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,823
that these weren't stories
routinely told.

602
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:12,285
These were stories
one had to earn.

603
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,371
He could feel the wall coming down.

604
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:18,750
He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

605
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,837
Which is why the next six words
changed everything.

606
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,924
I've never told anybody
that before.

607
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,013
I guess I'm not just anybody.

608
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,557
So what are you exactly?

609
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,643
I don't know.
Are you her boyfriend?

610
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,937
It's not that simple.
- Sure, it is.

611
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,147
What, like, are we going steady?
- Come on, guys.

612
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,858
You know, we're-we're adults.
We know how we feel.

613
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,944
We don't need
to put labels on it.

614
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,946
I mean,
"boyfriend," "girlfriend."

615
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,533
All that stuff is-
It's really juvenile.

616
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,077
You sound gay.
You really do.

617
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,079
Okay, first of all,

618
00:40:56,163 --> 00:41:00,125
your last girlfriend
was Amy Sussman
in the seventh grade,

619
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,919
and you dated
for, like, three hours.

620
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:07,924
And you-
you've been with Robyn
since what-like 1998?

621
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,426
'97.
- '97. See-

622
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,304
Shoot.

623
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:17,642
I don't think the two of you
are exactly authorities
on modern relationships.

624
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,317
So, what should I do?
- You should ask her.

625
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,319
What?

626
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:31,030
Well, why rock the boat,
is what I'm thinking.

627
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,116
I mean, things are going well.

628
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,743
You start putting labels on it,
that's like the kiss of death.

629
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,664
It's like saying, "I love you."
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

630
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,625
That's what happened
between me and Sean.

631
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:45,336
Who the hell's Sean?
- My boyfriend before Mark.

632
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:47,714
Who the-never mind.

633
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,634
So, what you're saying-
I'm saying you do
want to ask her.

634
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,846
It's obvious.
You're just afraid you'll get
an answer you don't want,

635
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,017
which will shatter
all the illusions of how great
these past few months have been.

636
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,019
Now look, if it were me,

637
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,563
I'd find out now before you
show up at her place...

638
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,650
and, well, she's in bed
with Lars from Norway.

639
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,528
Who's Lars from Norway?

640
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,530
Just some guy
she met at the gym...

641
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:16,117
with Brad Pitt's face
and Jesus' abs.

642
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,580
Wait! No, Coach.
We're not done here.

643
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,707
Rachel!
- Look, it's easy, Tom.

644
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,792
Just don't be a pussy.

645
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,187
You okay?

646
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:47,398
Yeah.
- You sure?

647
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:50,109
Summer,
I gotta ask you something.

648
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,237
What?
- What are we, um-

649
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:57,075
What are we doing?
- I thought we were going
to the movies.

650
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,577
Yeah. Nah, I mean, like,
what are we, like-

651
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:02,288
What's going on here, with us?

652
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:04,332
I don't know.

653
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,835
Who cares?

654
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,964
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
- Yeah.

655
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:12,966
Good.

656
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,837
London, 1964.

657
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:52,880
Those girls knew how to dress.

658
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:56,551
Nowadays, it's all
these giant sunglasses...

659
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,886
and tattoos.

660
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,180
It's handbags with
little dogs in them.

661
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:05,268
Who okayed this?
Some people like it.

662
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:09,063
I like how you dress.

663
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:12,692
I was thinking about
getting a butterfly tattoo
about yea big on my ankle.

664
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,777
No.

665
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,571
Oh.

666
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,906
Yo.

667
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,908
How's it going?

668
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:23,161
Uh, okay.

669
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:25,496
You live around here?

670
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:27,749
Um, yeah, not too far.

671
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,126
I've never seen you here before.

672
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,337
You're not too observant.

673
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:35,423
That's funny. You're funny.

674
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:38,051
So let me buy you a drink.
- No, Thank you.

675
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:42,388
You with this guy?
- Hey, I'm Tom.

676
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:45,058
Whatever.
So, come on. One drink.
What are you drinking?

677
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:47,310
I said no, thanks.

678
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:49,270
You're serious? This guy?

679
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,356
Hey, buddy-
You know what?
Don't be rude.

680
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,483
I'm flattered,
but I'm not interested.

681
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:57,528
So why don't you go over there
and leave us alone? Thanks.

682
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,532
It's a free country.

683
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,753
I can't believe
this is your boyfriend.

684
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:22,762
What are you doing?

685
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,850
It was really just a crazy thing.

686
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,270
It happened like-
It felt like it happened
fast, but really,

687
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:34,440
it-it also felt like it
was happening really slowly,

688
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,484
like everything all was just-

689
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:40,238
I don't know. It doesn't
feel like you think it would-

690
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:43,032
Hey, what's the matter?

691
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:46,035
I just-I can't believe you.

692
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,371
You can't believe me?

693
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:51,165
You were so completely,
completely uncool in there.

694
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,336
Wait. Are you mad at me?
I just got my ass kicked for you.

695
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:57,713
Oh, really? Was that for me?
Was that for my benefit?

696
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,424
Yes, it was.

697
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:01,884
Okay, well, next time don't,
'cause I don't need your help.

698
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:05,430
You know what?
I'm really tired.

699
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:10,435
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

700
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,283
No. You know what?

701
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,786
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me what's going on.

702
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,872
Nothing's going on.

703
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,917
We're just-

704
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:39,255
What? We're just what?

705
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:43,134
We're just friends.
- No! Don't pull that with me!

706
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,219
Don't even try to-

707
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:48,681
This is not how
you treat your friend.

708
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:52,810
Kissing in the copy room?
Holding hands in IKEA?

709
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:55,730
Shower sex? Come on!
Friends, my balls!

710
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:04,655
I like you, Tom.
I just don't want a relationship-

711
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,241
Well, you're not the only one
that gets a say in this!

712
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:10,369
I do too! And I say we're
a couple, goddamn it!

713
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,836
After you, please.

714
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,329
I shouldn't have done that.

715
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,875
Done what?
- Gotten mad at you.

716
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,877
I'm sorry.

717
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:49,969
Look, we don't have to
put a label on it.

718
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:52,054
That's fine. I get it.

719
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,224
But, you know, I just-
I need some consistency.

720
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:57,685
I know.

721
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,771
I need to know that
you're not gonna wake up
in the morning...

722
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,482
and... feel differently.

723
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:13,242
And I can't give you that.

724
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,244
Nobody can.

725
00:49:24,338 --> 00:49:26,797
That hurt? I'm sorry.

726
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,383
No, it doesn't hurt.

727
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:31,802
I like you.

728
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:35,890
All right.

729
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,027
<i>♪ You loved her
You were kissing ♪</i>

730
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:52,615
Shh. well, what about you?
- Did you ever even
have a boyfriend?

731
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,617
Well, of course.
- Yeah?

732
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,661
Yeah.
Well, tell me about them.

733
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,663
No.
- Oh? why not?

734
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,040
Because it's not important.

735
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,626
I'm interested.

736
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:08,839
All right. Fine.
You want to go there?

737
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:11,133
Yeah. I can take it.
- Fine.

738
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,764
So-

739
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,934
Well, in high school
there was Markus.

740
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:22,311
Quarterback-slash-homecoming king?

741
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:24,897
No. He was a rower.

742
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,025
He was very hot.

743
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:33,656
For a brief time in college
there was, um-there was Charlie.

744
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,119
She was nice, but-

745
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,956
And then there was
my semester in Sienna.

746
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,041
Fernando Belardelli.

747
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,629
Also known as "The Puma."

748
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:52,174
- The Puma?
- Yeah, The Puma, 'cause, you know.

749
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,972
So-

750
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,308
Oh, that's it?
- The ones that lasted, yeah.

751
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:03,853
What happened? Why-
Why didn't they work out?

752
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:06,731
What always happens. Life.

753
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,530
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

754
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:17,575
No, it's not.
- It's awesome. Trust me.

755
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:19,577
I'm serious.

756
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:22,788
I'll go first.

757
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,209
Penis.

758
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,720
Penis.

759
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,972
Penis!
Penis!

760
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,016
Penis!
There's kids around.

761
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,477
There are no kids around.

762
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,771
Penis!
Penis!

763
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,023
You having fun?
- Yeah.

764
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,442
This is the kind of thing
you did with The Puma, isn't it?

765
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:54,779
Oh, we rarely left the room.

766
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:57,448
Penis!

767
00:51:57,574 --> 00:51:59,742
Sorry. Tourette's.
You know how it is.
Penis!

768
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,869
She has it too. Penis!
Penis!

769
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:05,456
Shh. Everyone's
looking over here.
- I'm done. I'm done.

770
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,166
Are you done?
- I'm done.

771
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,793
You're done?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:11,086
This is too much.
- Unleash me. I'm done.

773
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,172
Promise?
- I promise.

774
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:16,550
I promise.

775
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:18,928
Penis!

776
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:36,111
It's very complex.
- Mmm.

777
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:39,240
In a way, it sort of, like,

778
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:42,117
says... so much...

779
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,995
by...

780
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,373
saying so little.

781
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:56,715
Do you want to go to the movies?
- Yep.

782
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,485
Suffering.

783
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,155
So much suffering.

784
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:05,075
Suffering.
Suffering.

785
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,450
T-Tom?

786
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:49,036
Mr. Vance would like to
see you in his office.

787
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,873
Tom.

788
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:55,125
Have a seat.

789
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,632
Has something happened
to you recently?

790
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,717
What do you mean?

791
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:07,262
A death in the family,
someone taken ill-
Anything like that.

792
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:09,264
No.

793
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:13,018
Look, I don't mean to pry, but...

794
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:15,187
does this have something to do
with Summer leaving?

795
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,440
Who?
My assistant.

796
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:22,695
Your, um-Tom, everyone knows.

797
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,991
Never mind.

798
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:30,953
The reason I'm asking is,
lately your work performance...

799
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,706
has been... a little off.

800
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:36,750
I'm not following.
- Okay.

801
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:39,336
Um, here's something
that you wrote last week.

802
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:42,506
Uh, "Roses are red,
violets are blue.

803
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,842
Fuck you, whore."

804
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:47,678
Now, most shoppers
at Valentine's Day-

805
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,681
Mr. Vance, are you firing me?
- No. No.

806
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,809
Relax, Hansen.
You're one of the good ones.

807
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,520
Okay. Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

808
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,605
Things have been a little difficult.

809
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,026
That's okay. I completely
understand that.

810
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:06,530
I'm just saying
that perhaps you could
channel those energies,

811
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:09,950
um, into something like this.

812
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:15,581
Funerals and sympathy.

813
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:19,043
Misery, sadness, loss of faith,

814
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:21,253
no reason to live.

815
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:23,839
This is perfect for you.

816
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,425
Uh-
- Good. okay.

817
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,927
Now back to work you go.

818
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:35,684
Thank you.

819
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,035
Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,801
Don't you have, like,
20 cards to write by Friday?
- Nope. All done.

821
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:58,916
Really? Can you help me?
'Cause I've run out of ways
to say "congrats."

822
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,711
Okay. I got "Good job,"
"Well done" and "Way to go."

823
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:04,421
That's it.

824
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:08,592
How 'bout, "Every day
you make me proud,

825
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,678
but today you get a card."

826
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:14,306
Shit, that's good!
- I know.

827
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,769
Have you tried "Merry"?

828
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,147
Wow! That's perfect! Merry!
- Wow!

829
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:25,275
We've been stuck on this
for an hour.

830
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,654
Hmm. How about...

831
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:36,036
"I love us"?

832
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:37,579
Aw.

833
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,250
I hate Summer.

834
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,377
I hate her crooked teeth.

835
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,170
I hate her 1960s haircut.

836
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:46,964
I hate her knobby knees.

837
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:49,925
And I hate her cockroach-shaped
splotch on her neck.

838
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:52,928
I hate the way she smacks her lips
before she talks.

839
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,514
And I hate the way she sounds
when she laughs.

840
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:59,977
<i>♪ She's like the wind ♪</i>

841
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,062
I hate this song!

842
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:06,900
Son, you're gonna
have to exit the vehicle.

843
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:09,153
I normally don't do blind dates,

844
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:12,239
but Paul and Robyn spoke
very highly of you.

845
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:14,783
Ah.
- They said you write
greeting cards.

846
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:16,869
That's so interesting.
I wanted to write.

847
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:19,246
I actually majored
in English in college,

848
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,290
but what are you gonna do
with that degree?

849
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,542
I went to Brown.
Where did you go?
- Alison.

850
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,544
Hmm?

851
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,921
Listen, it's great to meet you,

852
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,382
and... you're a very attractive girl.

853
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:33,427
I just wanted to say up front
that this isn't-

854
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:37,014
It's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh.

855
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:40,767
I liked this girl.
I mean, I loved her.

856
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:42,769
What does she do?

857
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:46,481
She took a giant shit
on my face.

858
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,067
Literally.
- Literally?

859
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:53,322
Not literally.
That's disgusting. Jesus.

860
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,616
What's the matter with you?

861
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,618
The point is,

862
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,079
I'm messed up. I am.

863
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:03,415
You know, on the one hand,
I want to forget her.

864
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:05,417
On the other hand,

865
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:09,796
I know that she's the only person
in the entire universe
that will make me happy.

866
00:59:09,923 --> 00:59:11,882
Mm-hmm.
- You ever do this?

867
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:16,595
You think back on the times
you had with someone, replay it
in your head over and over again,

868
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:19,973
and you look for those
first signs of trouble.

869
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:24,561
There's two options really.

870
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:27,731
Either... she's an evil,

871
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:31,068
emotionless,
miserable human being,

872
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:35,239
or... she's a robot.

873
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,282
Small Wonder.
- You know, Vicki.

874
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:40,410
That would explain
a lot actually.
- Can I ask you a question?

875
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,997
Yeah.
- She never cheated on you?

876
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:48,418
No. Never.
- She ever take advantage
of you in any way?

877
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:50,420
No.

878
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:54,633
And she told you up front
that she didn't want a boyfriend.

879
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:58,220
Yeah.

880
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:05,185
I got a great idea.

886
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,955
Waste of time.
You don't look anything
like Summer.

887
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:30,544
Now departing on Track 2,
Pacific Surfliner.

888

All aboard, please.

890
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:44,182
Hey, baby.
- Hey, you here?

891
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,268
Hell no.
- What do you mean,
"Hell no"?

892
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:48,979
I'm not going to that.
- Yes, you are.

893
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,023
No, man. It's gonna be
all old people.

894
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:53,483
Yeah, but you said you were going.
That's why I'm going.

895
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:56,361
And that's why
I called her last night,
told her I was sick.

896
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,906
Like a ninja.
Dude! I'm gonna-I'm not gonna
know anybody at this thing.

897
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:02,451
Maybe you'll meet
some hot granddaughters
or something.

898
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:04,578
I'm hanging up now.
Bye, baby.

899
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,040
May I have your attention, please?

900
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:10,417
Passengers boarding the train
in Los Angeles, please...

901
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:13,003
have your tickets out
and ready for collection.

902
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,328
Hi, Tom!

903
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:48,789
Hey. Summer.

904
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:52,667
I must have walked right by you.
- Yeah.

905
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:55,796
Well, um, what are you doing?
Are you going to Millie's?

906
01:01:58,174 --> 01:02:00,175
Me too.
Cool.

907
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:04,846
- I forgot you knew her.
- Yeah, we worked together
all that time, so-

908
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,391
of course.
I love Millie.
She's the sweetest.

909
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,518
She is.

910
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:11,895
- How are you?
- I'm good.

911
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:14,231
Good. I-I wrote to you.
I never heard back, but-

912
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:16,775
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that.
I-I just, you know-

913
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:20,195
It got kind of crazy,
and the holidays came up,
so work was-

914
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,697
You still working for Vance?

915
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:24,574
Yeah.

916
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:28,829

Yeah.
- That looks like a good book.

01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:38,046
Yeah, it's-

920
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:42,300
Well, I don't want to bother you.
- No, no. I, um-

921
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:44,761
Yeah, let's get coffee.

01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:33,031
In seventh grade
we had the same class schedule,

Doesn't make it less true.

988
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:05,522
I think technically
the "girl of my dreams"...

989
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:10,318
would probably have, like,
a really bodacious rack, you know.

990
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:12,821
Maybe different hair.

You know, she'd probably be
a little more into sports.

1087
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,799
That's not inspirational.
That's suicidal.

1088
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:09,844
If Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

1089
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:12,930
These are lies. we're liars.

1090
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:15,349
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

1091
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:17,769
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

1092
01:13:17,853 --> 01:13:21,814
People buy cards 'cause
they can't say how they feel,
or they're afraid to.

1093
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:24,317
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

1094
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,945
You know what?
I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

1095
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:30,615
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

1096
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:33,910
I mean, look! What-what is this?
What does it say?

1097
01:13:33,994 --> 01:13:35,912
"Congratulations
on your new baby." Right?

1098
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:38,206
How 'bout, "Congratulations
on your new baby."

1099
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:41,542
- That's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."
- Sit down, Hansen.

1100
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:45,588
How 'bout this one, with all
the pretty hearts on the front?
I know where this is going. Yep!

1101
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:49,258
"Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart. I love you."

1102
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:52,845
That sweet? Ain't love grand?

1103
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,098
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1104
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:57,266
What does that even mean, "love"?

1105
01:13:57,351 --> 01:14:00,144
Do you know? Do you? Anybody?

1106
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:01,646
Tom.

1107
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:04,732
If somebody gave me this card,
Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

1108
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:10,947
It's-It's these cards,
and the movies, and the pop songs-

1109
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:13,616
They're to blame for all the lies...

1110
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,078
and the heartache, everything.

1111
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:19,914
And we're responsible.
I'm responsible.

1112
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:25,795
I think we do a bad thing here.

1113
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:29,423
People should be able
to say how they feel-
how they really feel-

1114
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:33,636
not, you know, some words
that some strangers
put in their mouths.

1115
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,222
Words like "love"...

1116
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:41,519
that don't mean anything.

1117
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,897
Sorry. I'm sorry. I, uh-

1118
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:49,443
I quit. I'm-

1119
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:52,113
There's enough bullshit
in the world without my help.

1120
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:20,391
All right. Next we do running drills.

1121
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:22,643
Hey, you're sketching again.

1122
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:24,937
Yeah, well, just doodling.

1123
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:28,733
Okay, Tom. we got 20 seconds.
Talk to me. You okay?

1124
01:15:28,817 --> 01:15:31,068
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

1125
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:40,369
You know, my friends
are all in love with you.

1126
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:42,371
You know, it's like we said.

1127
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:45,666
Plenty of other fish in the sea.
- Thanks.

1128
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:48,002
But, uh, those are guppies.

1129
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:50,004
Yeah.

1130
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:53,382
Hey, Tom?
- Mmm.

1131
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:57,220
Look, I know you think
that she was the one,

1132
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:00,806
but I don't.

1133
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:04,143
Now, I think you're just
remembering the good stuff.

1134
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:07,230
Next time you look back, I, uh-

1135
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,815
I really think
you should look again.

1136
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:50,690
It's playing at 5:00.
Do you wanna see it?

1137
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:54,735
Um, I don't know.
We could just go back
to your place or-

1138
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,655
No, I really want to see it.
Let's go.

What-what is it?
The movie?

1145
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:39,447
It's nothing. I'm just-
I'm just being stupid.

Hey, Tom.

01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,671
I thought I might see you here.

1177
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:15,723
I always loved this place,
ever since you brought me.

1178
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:18,475
So I, uh-

1179
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,894
I guess I should say
congratulations.

1180
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:24,481
Only if you mean it.

1181
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:27,359
Ah. Well, in that case-

1182
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,994
So, are you okay?

1183
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:40,122
I will be, eventually.

1184
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:42,583
You wanna-
- Hmm.

1185
01:22:45,879 --> 01:22:48,005
I like your suit.
- Ah, thanks.

1186
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:50,382
You look sharp.

1187
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:53,552
So do you.
Thanks.

1188
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:56,138
I quit the office.
- You did?

1189
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:58,557
I didn't know. That's great!

1190
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,227
And you, um-

1191
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:05,189
you're married.

1192
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:07,941
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

1193
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:20,329
You should have told me
when we were at the-
I know.

1194
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:22,748
You know, at the wedding
when we were dancing.

1195
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:25,292
Well, he hadn't asked me yet.
But he was in your life.

1196
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:28,128
Yeah.
- So why'd you dance with me?

1197
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,175
'Cause I wanted to.

1198
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:38,097
You just do what you want,
don't you?

1199
01:23:45,313 --> 01:23:47,648
You never wanted to be
anybody's girlfriend,

1200
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:49,983
and now you're somebody's wife.

1201
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:52,152
Surprised me too.

1202
01:23:52,237 --> 01:23:55,030
I don't think I'll ever
understand that.

1203
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:59,118
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1204
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,579
It just happened.

1205
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:06,542
Right, but that's what
I don't understand.
What just happened?

1206
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:10,963
I just-I just woke up one day,
and I knew.

1207
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,965
Knew what?

1208
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,803
What I was never sure of with you.

1209
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:33,986
You know what sucks?

1210
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:37,448
Realizing that everything
you believe in is complete
and utter bullshit.

1211
01:24:37,532 --> 01:24:39,533
It sucks.
- What do you mean?

1212
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:43,579
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

1213
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:48,333
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

1214
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:50,711
You were right.
I-I should have listened to you.

1215
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:54,298
No.
- Yeah. what?
What are you smiling at?

1216
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:57,968
Tom.
- What?

1217
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:02,389
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1218
01:25:02,474 --> 01:25:05,100
Well, you know,

1219
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:07,394
I guess it's 'cause...

1220
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:10,022
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray

1221
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:12,608
and... a guy comes up to me...

1222
01:25:12,692 --> 01:25:15,277
and asked me about it,

1223
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:18,363
and... now he's my husband.

1224
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,660
Yeah. And... so?

1225
01:25:23,745 --> 01:25:27,623
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

1226
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:32,628
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

1227
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:36,048
What if I'd gotten there
10 minutes later?

1228
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,635
It was-

1229
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:42,054
It was meant to be.

1230
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,807
And I just kept thinking,

1231
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:48,560
Tom was right.
- No.

1232
01:25:48,645 --> 01:25:50,729
Yeah, I did.

1233
01:25:50,814 --> 01:25:53,315
I did.

1234
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:02,533
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

1235
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:31,019
I should go.

1236
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:34,106
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

1237
01:26:41,573 --> 01:26:43,574
Summer!

1238
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:47,786
I really do hope
that you're happy.

1239
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:24,740
Most days of the year
are unremarkable.

1240
01:27:24,824 --> 01:27:27,910
They begin and they end...

1241
01:27:27,994 --> 01:27:31,914
with no lasting memories
made in between.

1242
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:34,541
Most days have no impact...

1243
01:27:34,626 --> 01:27:36,627
on the course of a life.

1244
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,505
May 23 was a Wednesday.

1245
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:01,193
Are you interviewing?
- Sorry?

1246
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:04,905
Are you interviewing
for the position?

1247
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,532
Oh, yeah. why? Are you?
- Yeah.

1248
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,534
Mm-hmm.

1249
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:11,745
My competition.

1250
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:14,498
It would appear.

1251
01:28:14,582 --> 01:28:18,752
Yeah. So, a little awkward.

1252
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,754
Yeah.

1253
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:26,718
Well, I hope you, um,
don't get the job.

1254
01:28:26,803 --> 01:28:30,305
Well, I hope you
don't get the job.

1255
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:35,268
Have I seen you before?

1256
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:37,354
Me? I don't think so.

1257
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:41,149
Do you ever go to Angelus Plaza?

1258
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:44,152
Yes. That's, like,
my favorite spot in the city.

1259
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,196
Yeah. Okay. Except for
the parking lots, but-

1260
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:48,198
Yeah. I-I agree.
- Yeah, yeah.

1261
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:50,325
I think I've seen you there.
- Really?

1262
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:53,286
Yeah.
- I haven't seen you.

1263
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,666
You must not have been looking.

1264
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,751
If Tom had learned anything,

1265
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:02,879
it was that you can't ascribe
great cosmic significance...

1266
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:05,090
to a simple earthly event.

1267
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:10,721
Coincidence.
That's all anything ever is.

1268
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:12,806
Nothing more than coincidence.

1269
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:15,225
Tom Hansen.
- Yeah.

1270
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:17,310
Come on back.
- Thank you.

1271
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:22,607
Tom had finally learned
there are no miracles.

1272
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:25,193
There's no such thing as fate.

1273
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,696
Nothing is meant to be.

1274
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,366
He knew. He was sure of it now.

1275
01:29:31,451 --> 01:29:34,119
Tom was-
- Sorry. Um-

1276
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,413
I just left, uh-
Can I-one second.

1277
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:39,249
He was pretty sure.

1278
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:42,419
- Hey.
- You again.

1279
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,838
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

1280
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:48,175
if maybe after this, if, um, you-

1281
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:52,721
you want to get some coffee
or something.

1282
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:54,806
Oh, I'm sorry.

1283
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:58,935
I'm sort of supposed to
meet someone after this.

1284
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,979
Okay.

1285
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:10,197
Sure.

1286
01:30:10,323 --> 01:30:12,908
What's that?
Why not?

1287
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:16,244
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh-
I'll wait for you-

1288
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:18,538
We-We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

1289
01:30:18,623 --> 01:30:22,834
- My name's Tom.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.
