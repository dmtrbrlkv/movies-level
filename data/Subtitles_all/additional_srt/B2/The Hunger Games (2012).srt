1
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,313
<i>I think it's our tradition.

2
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:06,067
It comes out of a particularly
painful part of our history.

3
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,363
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.

4
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:12,615
At first, it was
a reminder of the rebellion.

5
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:15,535
It was a price the districts had to pay.

6
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,871
But I think it has grown from that.

7
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,374
I think it's something
that knits us all together.

8
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,462
This is your third year as Gamemaker.

9
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:30,592
What defines your personal signature?

10
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:41,227
It's okay. It's okay.
You were just dreaming.

11
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:44,647
It was me.

12
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,860
I know. I know. But it's not.

13
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,155
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.

14
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,324
They're not gonna pick you.

15
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,576
Try to go to sleep.

16
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,869
I can't.

17
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,372
Just try. Just try.

18
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:16,179
<i>Deep in the meadow

19
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,600
<i>Under the willow

20
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,772
<i>A bed of grass

21
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:29,859
<i>A soft green pillow

22
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,780
You remember that song? Okay.

23
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,157
You finish it. I've got to go.

24
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,283
Where?

25
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,327
I've just got to go.

26
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,455
<i>But I'll be back. I love you

27
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,841
I'll still cook you.

28
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,014
What are you gonna
do with that when you kill it?

29
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,520
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!

30
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,648
What are you gonna do
with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?

31
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,275
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.

32
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,487
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.

33
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,780
Of course you were.

34
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,115
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.

35
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,533
No. Not today.

36
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,619
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.

37
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,174
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?

38
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,384
They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?

39
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,011
Won't happen.

40
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,180
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.

41
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,514
It's sick.
- Gale.

42
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,975
If no one watches,
then they don't have a game.

43
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,518
It's as simple as that.

44
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,187
What?
-Nothing.

45
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,316
Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

46
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,199
We could do it, you know?

47
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,411
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.

48
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,537
They'd catch us.

49
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,247
Well, maybe not.

50
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,376
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.

51
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,296
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.

52
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,049
I have Prim,
and you have your brothers.

53
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,133
They can come, too.

54
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,718
Prim in the woods?

55
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,263
Or maybe not.

56
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,475
I'm never having kids.

57
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,728
I might, if I didn't live here.

58
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,980
But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.

59
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,902
Oh, I forgot.

60
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,570
Here.

61
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh, my God! Is this real?

62
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,408
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.

63
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,745
Happy Hunger Games.

64
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,790
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."

65
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,755
How many times is your name in today?

66
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,173
42.

67
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,010
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.

68
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,747
Thank you, girl.

69
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,132
What's this?

70
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,718
That's a Mockingjay.

71
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,263
How much?

72
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:37,310
You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

73
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,115
Mom.

74
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,452
Look at you!

75
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,996
You look beautiful.

76
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,707
But you better tuck in that tail, little duck.

77
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,417
I laid something out for you, too.

78
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,906
Now you look beautiful, too.

79
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,699
Wish I looked like you.

80
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,954
I wish I looked like you, little duck.

81
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,545
You want to see what I got you today?

82
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,551
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.

83
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:58,015
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.

84
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,267
I promise.

85
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,952
Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.

86
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,787
It's time to sign in now.

87
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,998
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.

88
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,207
You didn't say...
- I know.

89
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,876
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.

90
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,880
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?

91
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,897
Go ahead. Next.

92
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,745
<i>Welcome!

93
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,498
<i>Happy Hunger Games.

94
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,919
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.

95
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,800
<i>Now, before we begin,
we have a very special film.

96
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,554
<i>Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.

97
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,393
War. Terrible war.

98
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,734
<i>Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.

99
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,446
<i>This was the uprising that rocked our land.

100
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,492
<i>Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,

101
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,411
<i>loved them, protected them.

102
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:09,373
<i>Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.

103
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,336
<i>And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.

104
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,716
<i>A people rose up from the ashes,
and a new era was born.

105
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,679
<i>But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.

106
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:28,350
<i>We swore as a nation
we would never know this treason again.

107
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:33,647
<i>And so it was decreed that each year
the various districts of Panem

108
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:37,359
<i>would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman

109
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:42,615
<i>to fight to the death in a pageant of honor,
courage, and sacrifice.

110
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,994
<i>The lone victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder

111
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,122
<i>of our generosity and our forgiveness.

112
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,875
<i>This is how we remember our past.

113
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,004
<i>This is how we safeguard our future.

114
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,672
<i>I just love that!

115
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,137
<i>Now, the time has come for us to select

116
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:09,099
<i>one courageous young man and woman

117
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:17,066
<i>for the honor of representing District 12
in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

118
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,904
<i>As usual, ladies first.

119
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,598
<i>Primrose Everdeen.

120
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,607
<i>Where are you, dear?

121
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,526
<i>Come on up.

122
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,320
<i>Well, come on up.

123
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,469
Prim!

124
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,724
I volunteer!

125
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,476
I volunteer as Tribute!

126
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,733
<i>I believe we have a volunteer, Mr. Mayor.

127
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,776
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.

128
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,194
Go find Mom!

129
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,904
Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!

130
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,450
Go find Mom. Prim, leave!

131
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,415
<i>A dramatic turn of events
here in District 12.

132
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,255
<i>District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.

133
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,844
Come on, dear.

134
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,105
<i>What's your name?

135
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,857
<i>Katniss Everdeen.

136
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,861
<i>I bet my hat that was
your sister, wasn't it?

137
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,828
<i>Let's have a big hand for
our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.

138
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,886
<i>And now for the boys.

139
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,231
<i>Peeta Mellark.

140
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,506
<i>Here we are.

141
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,427
<i>Our Tributes from District 12.

142
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,388
<i>Well, go on, you two, shake hands.

143
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,570
<i>Happy Hunger Games.

144
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,866
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.

145
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,881
You have three minutes.

146
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,802
It's okay.

147
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:18,265
Prim, I don't have much time.

148
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,895
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

149
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,189
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?

150
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,234
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

151
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,904
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

152
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,989
Of course.

153
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,992
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?

154
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,828
And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

155
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,836
To protect you.

156
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,900
You can't tune out again.

157
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,862
I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

158
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,614
I won't be there anymore. You're all she has.

159
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,742
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

160
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,787
Don't cry.

161
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,459
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

162
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,672
It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

163
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,678
I promise, Prim.

164
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,613
I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

165
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,906
I am.

166
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,828
Listen to me. You're stronger
than they are. You are.

167
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

168
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,498
They will if you show them
how good you are.

169
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,709
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

170
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,627
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

171
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,212
You know how to hunt.

172
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,547
Animals.

173
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,341
It's no different, Katniss.

174
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,513
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.

175
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,765
And it's gonna be you.

176
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,644
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

177
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,771
Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

178
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,693
You two are in for a treat.

179
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,447
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.

180
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,699
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

181
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,243
Now, before you do anything else...

182
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,260
<i>200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.

183
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,097
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,

184
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,725
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,

185
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,353
you get to enjoy all of this.

186
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,444
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

187
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,375
Have you ever met him?

188
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,421
Haymitch?

189
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,887
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

190
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,147
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,

191
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,442
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.

192
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,926
Congratulations.

193
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,489
Where's the ice?

194
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,450
I don't know.

195
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:35,957
May I?

196
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,549
Okay, so... So when do we start?

197
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,135
So eager.

198
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,639
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.

199
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,225
I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

200
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,643
You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

201
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,020
Yeah, our mentor.

202
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,773
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.

203
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,155
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

204
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,371
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.

205
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,374
So why are you here then?

206
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,626
The refreshments.

207
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,169
Okay, I think that's enough of that.

208
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,594
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

209
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,683
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

210
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,576
He's gonna come around.

211
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,785
It's no use.

212
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,787
I'm gonna go talk to him.

213
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,839
<i>We have two very fit 16-year-olds.

214
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,259
<i>Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.

215
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,677
<i>Yes, yes, they do.

216
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,637
<i>Do you remember this year?
Of course.

217
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,308
<i>One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.

218
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,311
<i>The use of the rubble in the ruined city...

219
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,645
<i>Very exciting

220
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,314
<i>And this moment here,

221
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,983
<i>this moment is a moment
that you never forget.

222
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,571
<i>The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.

223
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,651
You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

224
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,361
That's a good way to get killed.

225
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,029
What's a good way to get killed?

226
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,033
Why don't you join us?

227
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,536
I was just giving
some life-saving advice.

228
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,498
Like what?

229
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,875
I was just asking about how to find shelter.

230
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,046
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

231
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,800
How do you find shelter?

232
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,802
Pass the jam.

233
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,679
How do you find shelter?

234
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,556
Give me a chance to wake up, sweetheart.

235
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:43,895
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.

236
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,403
Can you pass the marmalade?

237
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,739
That is mahogany!

238
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,994
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.

239
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,747
You really want to know how to stay alive?

240
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,001
You get people to like you.

241
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,172
Not what you were expecting?

242
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:17,470
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,

243
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,974
some water, a knife, or even some matches

244
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,560
can mean the difference
between life and death.

245
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,063
And those things only come from sponsors.

246
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,735
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.

247
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:38,241
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.

248
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,577
There it is.

249
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,208
It's huge!

250
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,836
That's incredible.

251
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,029
Peeta, I love you.

252
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,831
Come on. Come on.

253
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:35,298
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

254
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,852
<i>So now that you've seen them,

255
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,730
<i>what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?

256
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:54,025
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

257
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,652
It's really hard to
tell just from a Reaping,

258
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,155
but I think this is
a very interesting mix.

259
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,449
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

260
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,868
<i>that's something you can't ignore.

261
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,480
What's that?

262
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,235
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again

263
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,445
before we take you to Cinna.

264
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,206
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

265
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,500
My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

266
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,044
I'm sorry that this happened to you,

267
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,088
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

268
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,634
Most people just congratulate me.

269
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:04,012
Well, I don't see the point in that.

270
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:38,807
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.

271
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:42,853
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.

272
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:44,688
So you're here to make me look pretty?

273
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:46,106
I'm here to help you make an impression.

274
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:50,027
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.

275
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,488
We're always coalminers.
- But I don't wanna do that.

276
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,991
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.

277
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:58,619
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?

278
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:01,413
But I'm not very good at making friends.

279
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:03,082
We'll see.

280
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,877
I just think somebody that brave

281
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,132
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?

282
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:15,969
I hope not.

283
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:25,229
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

284
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:28,565
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.

285
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:29,900
Looks pretty real to me.

286
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:31,568
Well, that's the idea.

287
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:32,653
You ready?

288
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,197
Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

289
00:31:55,592 --> 00:32:01,014
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

290
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:04,101
<i>And the sponsors get to see
the Tributes for the first time.

291
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:07,104
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.

292
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:13,402
Very nice.

293
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:18,699
First chariot on my count, in...

294
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:24,705
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

295
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,790
<i>It's the most exciting part.

296
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:28,792
<i>It just gives you goose bumps.

297
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:31,003
<i>And don't you love how the stylists,

298
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:35,382
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?

299
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:38,469
<i>Right. Right. There's District 4.
Yes.

300
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:40,471
<i>Fishing.
- I get it.

301
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:42,723
<i>I like it.
- That's very good.

302
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:47,853
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?

303
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,649
What is that in the background?

304
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:20,594
Come on. They'll love it.

305
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,229
<i>Now see that? I love that.

306
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:33,023
<i>Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,

307
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:36,902
<i>"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."

308
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,153
Nope.
- I love that!

309
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:40,948
<i>People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.

310
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,077
And we're ready.

311
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:46,662
<i>President Snow, you're live.

312
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,402
Welcome.

313
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:23,574
<i>Welcome.

314
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:28,036
<i>Tributes, we welcome you.

315
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:35,085
<i>We salute your courage and your sacrifice.

316
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,841
<i>And we wish you

317
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:44,845
<i>Happy Hunger Games.

318
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,182
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.

319
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:03,780
That was amazing.

320
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:06,366
We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.

321
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:08,118
So brave.

322
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,329
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?

323
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:13,749
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

324
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:25,302
Let's go upstairs.

325
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,183
So, each of the districts
get their own floor.

326
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:34,728
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

327
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:49,368
So this is the living room.

328
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,245
I know, I know.

329
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:55,749
Now, your rooms are right over here.

330
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:59,586
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?

331
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:20,959
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.

332
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:23,003
One of you will be alive.

333
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:27,466
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,

334
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:30,135
particularly to what I'm about to say.

335
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:33,305
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.

336
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:35,265
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.

337
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,228
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

338
00:37:40,312 --> 00:37:43,315
My advice is
don't ignore the survival skills.

339
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:44,983
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

340
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,778
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

341
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,740
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.

342
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:54,701
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

343
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:29,236
Jason, where's my knife?
- I didn't touch your knife.

344
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,905
I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

345
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:33,532
Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

346
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:35,200
You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

347
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:36,284
You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

348
00:38:36,368 --> 00:38:38,495
You little punk! He took my knife!

349
00:38:38,578 --> 00:38:40,330
Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

350
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:42,999
I'll finish you right now, kid!

351
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,793
Actually, better yet,
I'll wait for the Arena.

352
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,378
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.

353
00:38:50,173 --> 00:38:53,051
Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

354
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:55,512
He's a Career. You know what that is?

355
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:57,597
From District 1.
- And 2.

356
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:01,518
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.

357
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,813
By that point, they're pretty lethal.

358
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:06,982
But they don't receive any special treatment.

359
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:09,568
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

360
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:12,654
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.

361
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:15,448
So how good are they?

362
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:20,036
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

363
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,371
Almost.

364
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:23,623
they can be arrogant.

365
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:27,711
And arrogance can be a big problem.

366
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,048
I hear you can shoot.

367
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:36,052
I'm all right.

368
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:38,680
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

369
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,809
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.

370
00:39:44,603 --> 00:39:46,396
Peeta's strong.
- What?

371
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:48,899
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.

372
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:51,359
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

373
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:53,069
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning

374
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,404
if somebody comes after you with a knife.

375
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,532
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

376
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:05,832
It's true. Everybody knows it.

377
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:11,171
You know what my mother said?

378
00:40:11,421 --> 00:40:14,591
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.

379
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:16,760
But she wasn't talking about me.

380
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:20,222
She was talking about you.

381
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,437
I'm not very hungry.

382
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,601
I'm done, too.

383
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,271
Throw that metal thing over there.

384
00:41:55,442 --> 00:41:57,944
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.

385
00:41:58,028 --> 00:41:59,029
I don't care what Haymitch said.

386
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:01,156
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.

387
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,324
Throw it.

388
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:52,207
How did you do that?

389
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:56,002
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.

390
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,338
I'll show you.

391
00:43:00,965 --> 00:43:02,008
See?

392
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:08,681
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

393
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:38,711
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.

394
00:43:39,337 --> 00:43:42,674
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.

395
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:45,468
This is the time to show them everything.

396
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:48,388
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.

397
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:50,223
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.

398
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:54,769
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

399
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:59,315
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

400
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:13,037
<i>Katniss Everdeen.

401
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:26,176
Hey, Katniss?

402
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,553
Shoot straight.

403
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:30,532
Katniss Everdeen.

404
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:33,660
District 12.

405
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:01,664
Hey, hey, hey.

406
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:05,251
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

407
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:06,628
Did you get some pig yet?

408
00:47:24,604 --> 00:47:27,273
Thank you for your consideration.

409
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:35,198
Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

410
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:36,407
Mad?

411
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:42,205
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Not just you.

412
00:47:42,288 --> 00:47:43,831
They just want a good show. It's fine.

413
00:47:43,915 --> 00:47:47,502
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

414
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:52,006
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

415
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:57,887
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

416
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:03,393
What did they do when you shot the apple?

417
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,812
Well, they looked pretty startled.

418
00:48:09,649 --> 00:48:11,734
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."

419
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:13,403
Thanks for your consideration.
-"...your consideration."

420
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:15,822
Genius!

421
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:20,576
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

422
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,120
On who? On her?

423
00:48:22,995 --> 00:48:24,414
On him?

424
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:27,500
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

425
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:31,170
I would have given anything to see it.

426
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:34,924
<i>As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12

427
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:37,844
<i>after three days of careful evaluation.

428
00:48:38,052 --> 00:48:41,639
<i>The Gamekeepers would like to
acknowledge that it was an exceptional...

<i>From District 1, Marvel,
with a score of nine.

430

431
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:52,984

<i>From District 8...

00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:02,869
<i>And Rue with a score of seven.

436
00:49:02,952 --> 00:49:04,662
<i>Now our final district.

437
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:09,417
<i>From District 12. Peeta Mellark.

438
00:49:13,379 --> 00:49:15,923
<i>A score of eight.

439
00:49:17,216 --> 00:49:18,509
Excellent.
- Peeta!

440
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:19,635
Bravo.

441
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,929
We can work with that.
- Good job.

442
00:49:24,682 --> 00:49:25,725
<i>And finally,

443
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:29,604
<i>from District 12,

<i>Eleven.

447

Katniss!
- Outstanding!

448
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:48,790
11?

449
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:50,958
Congratulations.

450
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,376
I thought they hated me.

451
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,795
They must have liked your guts.

452
00:49:53,878 --> 00:49:58,007
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

453
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:00,927
Goodness. We are.

454
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:02,261
An 11?

455
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,721
She earned it.

456
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:05,848
She shot an arrow at your head.

457
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:07,225
Well, at an apple.

458
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:08,559
Near your head.

459
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:10,603
Sit down.

460
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,945
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?

461
00:50:21,447 --> 00:50:22,782
What do you mean?

462
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,453
I mean, why do we have a winner?

463
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:31,958
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

464
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:36,629
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?

465
00:50:36,712 --> 00:50:38,464
Be a lot faster.

466
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,884
Hope.

467
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:43,928
Hope?

468
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:45,096
Hope.

469
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:49,058
It is the only thing stronger than fear.

470
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,355
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

471
00:50:54,438 --> 00:50:57,733
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.

472
00:51:02,488 --> 00:51:05,408
So contain it.

473
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:37,995
Right.

474
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,331
So she's staring at all my jewels
She cannot take her eyes off of them.

475
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:42,666
Well, look at all that
that you're wearing.

476
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:43,750
Frankly, it was rude.

477
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,545
Haymitch, you should join us.

478
00:51:46,628 --> 00:51:49,089
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.

479
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,340
Oh, lovely.

480
00:51:54,428 --> 00:51:56,305
Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

481
00:51:56,388 --> 00:52:00,267
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.

482
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,978
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,

483
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:05,856
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.

484
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:08,859
What about him?

485
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,030
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

486
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:20,912
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?

487
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,463
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

488
00:52:34,426 --> 00:52:37,929
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
your master of ceremonies,

489
00:52:38,013 --> 00:52:40,724
<i>Caesar Flickerman!

00:52:55,906 --> 00:53:00,035

493
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:04,164
<i>Are you excited?

494
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,625
<i>Let me hear it!

495
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:11,213
Amazing.

496
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,424
I don't feel amazing.

497
00:53:14,508 --> 00:53:16,426
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

498
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,345
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.

499
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,014
How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

500
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:22,391
That's different. I wasn't trying.

501
00:53:22,474 --> 00:53:26,478
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

502
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,107
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?

503
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,527
<i>Let's see if she does indeed shine.

504
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,030
<i>Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!

505
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,245
<i>Glimmer, are you prepared?

506
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,580
<i>Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.

507
00:53:45,664 --> 00:53:48,417
<i>I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.

508
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,710
<i>Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...

509
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,586
<i>I'm wearing one of our own creations.

510
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:54,464
<i>A big round of applause!

511
00:53:57,092 --> 00:53:58,093
Marvel!

512
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,931
<i>Welcome, Clove.

513
00:54:03,014 --> 00:54:04,891
It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

514
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,394
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.

515
00:54:08,603 --> 00:54:09,813
Cato!

516
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:13,400
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,

517
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,776
I will be able to figure it out.

518
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,321
<i>Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.

519
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:23,243
<i>Good. So you can climb trees.

520
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,704
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?

521
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:27,372
<i>A gatherer?

522
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,257
<i>From District 12, District 12...

523
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,510
<i>You know her as The Girl on Fire!

524
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,433
<i>Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!

525
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,701
<i>Welcome!

526
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:12,876
<i>Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.

527
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,842
I think someone's a little nervous.

528
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:25,514
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made

529
00:55:25,597 --> 00:55:27,349
at the Tribute Parade the other day.

530
00:55:27,432 --> 00:55:29,601
Do you want to tell us about it?

531
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:33,980
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.

532
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:43,990
When you came out of that chariot,

533
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:47,577
I have to say, my heart stopped.

534
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:50,580
Did any of you experience this as well?

535
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:52,082
My heart stopped.

536
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:56,461
So did mine.

537
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,550
Now, tell me about the flames.
Are they real?

538
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:11,226
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

539
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,063
Wait. Is it safe?

540
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,108
What do you think, folks?

541
00:56:20,026 --> 00:56:21,069
I think that's a yes.

542
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:50,307
Steady.

543
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:52,809
Lovely. Thank you.

544
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:58,440
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

545
00:56:58,523 --> 00:57:00,901
That was something. Thank you for that.

546
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,530
I have one more question for you.

547
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:08,533
It's about your sister.

548
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:17,334
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

549
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,047
Did she come and say goodbye to you?

550
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,300
She did.

551
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:31,181
And what did you say to her in the end?

552
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,686
I told her that I would try to win.

553
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:40,523
That I would try to win for her.

554
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,026
Of course you did.

555
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,488
And try you will.

556
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:50,283
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

557
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,870
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

558
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:02,295
You did it, darling. That was incredible.

559
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,341
Nice job, sweetheart.

560
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:10,053
Nice dress, too.

561
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,766
<i>Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!

562
00:58:21,189 --> 00:58:22,941
<i>Peeta, welcome.

563
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,153
<i>How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map. "

564
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,864
<i>It's different.
It's very different than back home.

565
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:32,826
<i>Different. In what way? Give us an example.

566
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,245
<i>Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.

567
00:58:35,537 --> 00:58:36,746
The showers?

568
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,415
We have different showers.

569
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:42,502
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

570
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:46,423
Take a whiff?
- All right.

571
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,968
You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

572
00:58:56,808 --> 00:58:59,310
You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

573
00:58:59,394 --> 00:59:00,562
That makes sense.

574
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,694
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

575
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,364
is there a special girl back home?

576
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:13,074
Not really.

577
00:59:13,324 --> 00:59:17,370
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

578
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:21,416
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.

579
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,132
There is this one girl that
I've had a crush on forever.

580
00:59:30,258 --> 00:59:34,345
But I don't think she actually
recognized me until the Reaping.

581
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,975
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

582
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,938
You go out there and you win this thing,

583
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:47,650
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.

584
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:49,360
Right, folks?

585
00:59:52,614 --> 00:59:56,242
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.

586
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:57,702
And why not?

587
01:00:01,289 --> 01:00:03,500
Because she came here with me.

588
01:00:07,754 --> 01:00:09,339
<i>Well, that's bad luck.

589
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,299
<i>Yeah, it is.

590
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,346
<i>And I wish you all the best of luck.

591
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:18,807
<i>Peeta Mellark.

592
01:00:19,766 --> 01:00:21,476
<i>District 12!

593
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,523
What the hell was that?

594
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:28,608
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?

595
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,777
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

596
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,487
Stop it!

597
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,738
Let's start right now!

598
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,867
He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

599
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:41,788
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

600
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:42,914
He's right, Katniss.

601
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:44,207
Of course I'm right.

602
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:47,710
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...

603
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:49,295
We are not star-crossed lovers.

604
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,131
It's a television show!

605
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:54,968
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

606
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,387
which could save your damn life.

607
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,099
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?

608
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:05,061
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.

609
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:06,563
Manners!

610
01:01:37,635 --> 01:01:38,928
You, too?

611
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:43,683
Can't sleep?

612
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,476
No. Of course not.

613
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:50,148
I'm sorry I went after you.

614
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:55,111
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

615
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:56,821
I know.

616
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,709
Listen to them.

617
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:19,636
I just don't want them to change me.

618
01:02:51,055 --> 01:02:52,765
How would they change you?

619
01:02:56,102 --> 01:02:59,439
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

620
01:03:01,274 --> 01:03:04,694
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?

621
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:08,239
You mean you won't kill anyone?

622
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:15,079
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

623
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:16,247
when the time came,

624
01:03:17,749 --> 01:03:21,669
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them

625
01:03:21,753 --> 01:03:23,504
that they don't own me.

626
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:31,220
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

627
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:38,769
Does that make any sense?

628
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:44,442
I just can't afford to think like that.

629
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,656
I have my sister.

630
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,202
Yeah, I know.

631
01:04:08,925 --> 01:04:11,177
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

632
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:15,640
See you tomorrow.

633
01:04:40,748 --> 01:04:45,753
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

634
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:48,589
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.

635
01:04:48,673 --> 01:04:49,924
Why not?

636
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:52,218
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

637
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:53,719
That's not your game.

638
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:57,765
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.

639
01:04:57,848 --> 01:05:00,059
Water's your new best friend.

640
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:04,855
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

641
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,190
I won't.

642
01:05:18,244 --> 01:05:21,330
Katniss, you can do this.

643
01:05:35,553 --> 01:05:37,179
Give me your arm.

644
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,985
Give me your arm.
- What is that?

645
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:55,239
Your tracker.

646
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:57,783
We're up.

647
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:05,750
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.

648
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:08,169
There are 15 out. They are flying.

649
01:07:17,279 --> 01:07:18,781
30 seconds.

650
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:30,251
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.

651
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:43,556
<i>20 seconds.

652
01:07:55,943 --> 01:07:57,695
<i>10 seconds.

653
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:25,848
Okay, they're in the tubes.

654
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:51,780
And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,

655
01:12:51,864 --> 01:12:54,867
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.

656
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:49,857
25? Got it.

657
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:55,612
He's moving now.

658
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:31,458
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

659
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:34,920
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.

660
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:42,094
Wait!
Did you see the look on her face?

661
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:44,054
How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

662
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:47,599
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me!"

663
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:50,018
That's actually a good impression.

664
01:16:50,394 --> 01:16:51,520
Hey, lover boy!

665
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:55,440
You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

666
01:16:56,483 --> 01:16:57,734
You better be.

667
01:16:57,818 --> 01:17:00,779
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.

668
01:17:06,493 --> 01:17:08,745
Are you sure
we shouldn't just kill him now?

669
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,664
He's our best chance of finding her.

670
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:12,749
Let's go.

671
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:34,396
Sir?

672
01:17:36,481 --> 01:17:38,692
She is almost at the edge.

673
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:41,361
<i>Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.

674
01:17:41,445 --> 01:17:42,779
<i>Let's turn her around.

675
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:46,510
Cueing another. On my count.

676
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,524
She's heading towards the left flank.

677
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,943
Can you give me a tree right there?

678
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:05,654
Sure. Cueing tree.

679
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,040
She's almost there.

680
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:14,890
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

681
01:20:26,943 --> 01:20:28,445
There she is!

682
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:33,700
She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

683
01:20:38,246 --> 01:20:40,373
Where you gonna go?
- Mine!

684
01:20:40,457 --> 01:20:43,001
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.

685
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:51,384
There she is!
- Yeah!

686
01:20:56,389 --> 01:20:57,849
Here we go!

687
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:06,066
Where you going?
- Get her, Cato!

688
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:07,734
Where do you think you're going?

689
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:12,656
Where you going, baby?

690
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:15,158
Three o'clock.

691
01:21:17,702 --> 01:21:19,788
Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!

692
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:21,414
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!

693
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:22,832
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.

694
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:24,626
Where are you going?

695
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:27,462
Go get her, man!
You are so done.

696
01:21:27,546 --> 01:21:29,548
Just get her, Cato!

697
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:31,550
He's gonna get you, Katniss.
Look at her scurry.

698
01:21:31,633 --> 01:21:32,634
Right up there.

699
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,220
Kill her!
Just go, keep going!

700
01:21:36,346 --> 01:21:38,098
Go, Cato.
Come on, Cato.

701
01:21:38,181 --> 01:21:39,182
She's right there.
Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!

702
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:40,308
You got this.

703
01:21:40,392 --> 01:21:41,351
Go! He's got this.

704
01:21:41,434 --> 01:21:43,937
Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!

705
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,564
Take her down!

706
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:47,524
You got this, Cato! Come on, kill her!

707
01:21:47,607 --> 01:21:49,025
I'm coming for you!

708
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:50,569
Come on, Cato!

709
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:56,408
I'll do it myself.

710
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,041
Give me that before...

711
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,168
Get her.

712
01:22:09,921 --> 01:22:12,299
Maybe you should throw the sword!

713
01:22:12,757 --> 01:22:14,676
Let's just wait her out.

714
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,849
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.

715
01:22:20,932 --> 01:22:22,142
We'll just kill her then.

716
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:29,983
Somebody make a fire.

717
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:44,497
Let's make camp over here!
Hurry up with the fire.

718
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:43,890
Boys.

719
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:36,896
Claudius, I think those are
tracker jackers Am I wrong?

720
01:26:39,482 --> 01:26:42,277
Those things are very lethal.
- Very.

721
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,444
For those of you who don't know,

722
01:26:43,528 --> 01:26:48,783
tracker jackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,

723
01:26:49,242 --> 01:26:54,414
<i>powerful hallucinations,
and in extreme cases, death.

724
01:29:53,301 --> 01:29:54,385
Run.

725
01:29:59,974 --> 01:30:01,350
Katniss, go!

726
01:30:02,185 --> 01:30:04,937
Get out of here! What are you doing?

727
01:30:16,657 --> 01:30:21,245
Not only is it lethal,
but the venom of a tracker jacker sting

728
01:30:22,288 --> 01:30:24,165
can produce powerful hallucinations.

729
01:31:24,684 --> 01:31:28,980
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!

730
01:31:29,564 --> 01:31:31,315
Katniss, go!

731
01:31:32,775 --> 01:31:35,528
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

732
01:32:36,422 --> 01:32:37,506
Rue?

733
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:43,638
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

734
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,782
You want mine, too?

735
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:05,451
No, that's okay.

736
01:33:06,535 --> 01:33:07,620
Here.

737
01:33:14,794 --> 01:33:16,420
How long was I asleep?

738
01:33:17,213 --> 01:33:20,424
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.

739
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,015
So what happened while I was out?

740
01:33:28,641 --> 01:33:31,352
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

741
01:33:35,398 --> 01:33:37,650
And the boy from my district?

742
01:33:38,567 --> 01:33:41,779
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.

743
01:33:45,157 --> 01:33:46,867
Is all of that true?

744
01:33:48,786 --> 01:33:50,121
You and him?

745
01:33:51,706 --> 01:33:53,708
So where are Cato and the others?

746
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:56,836
They got all their supplies
down by the lake.

747
01:33:56,919 --> 01:33:59,088
<i>It's piled up in this great big pyramid.

748
01:33:59,672 --> 01:34:01,507
That sounds tempting.

749
01:34:17,356 --> 01:34:19,400
Now, this green stuff
is gonna smoke like crazy,

750
01:34:19,483 --> 01:34:22,194
so as soon as you light it,
move on to the next fire.

751
01:34:22,278 --> 01:34:24,780
Light this one last,
and I'll meet you back over there.

752
01:34:24,864 --> 01:34:26,073
Right.

753
01:34:29,368 --> 01:34:32,455
And then I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

754
01:34:32,538 --> 01:34:34,790
We need a signal
in case one of us gets held up.

755
01:34:34,874 --> 01:34:36,042
Okay. Like what?

756
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,004
Here. Watch this.

757
01:34:45,718 --> 01:34:48,637
Mockingjays. That's great.

758
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:51,640
Back home,
we use them to signal all the time.

759
01:34:56,562 --> 01:34:57,772
You try.

760
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:08,949
Okay, so if we hear that,

761
01:35:09,033 --> 01:35:12,536
it means we're okay
and we'll be back real soon.

762
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:13,871
We're gonna be okay.

763
01:35:19,794 --> 01:35:22,755
I'll see you for supper.

764
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:57,957
Guys, look! Over here.

765
01:36:02,128 --> 01:36:03,170
Let's go.

766
01:36:03,587 --> 01:36:06,340
You stay guard and don't move
until we can get back.

767
01:36:35,077 --> 01:36:38,205
I want to see if she's gonna
figure out this booby trap.

768
01:36:38,497 --> 01:36:40,791
It seems they've reburied their mines

769
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:43,461
<i>around that big pile of goodies.

770
01:36:55,681 --> 01:36:58,601
<i>She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?

771
01:39:06,437 --> 01:39:08,564
I don't know what happened.

772
01:39:08,647 --> 01:39:11,275
What the hell happened?
- I don't know!

773
01:39:11,817 --> 01:39:12,818
Our stuff!

774
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:10,918
Katniss!

775
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:17,549
Katniss, help!

776
01:40:18,759 --> 01:40:20,177
Katniss!

777
01:40:43,117 --> 01:40:46,495
You're okay. You're fine. See?

778
01:41:28,287 --> 01:41:30,289
Did you blow up the food?

779
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:34,460
Every bit of it.

780
01:41:37,796 --> 01:41:38,964
Good.

781
01:41:41,008 --> 01:41:42,885
You have to win.

782
01:41:52,144 --> 01:41:53,812
Can you sing?

783
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:10,162
<i>Deep in the meadow

784
01:42:10,662 --> 01:42:14,333
<i>Under the willows

785
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:17,920
<i>A bed of grass

786
01:42:18,504 --> 01:42:22,549
<i>A soft green pillow

787
01:42:23,509 --> 01:42:26,303
<i>Lay down your head

788
01:42:27,012 --> 01:42:30,307
<i>and close your eyes

789
01:42:31,183 --> 01:42:36,188
<i>And when they open, the sun...

790
01:43:25,028 --> 01:43:26,029
I'm sorry.

791
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,741
I'm sorry.

792
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:28,462
<i>Don't kill her.
You'll just create a martyr.

793
01:46:28,545 --> 01:46:29,838
Well, it seems we've already got one.

794
01:46:29,921 --> 01:46:33,216
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.

795
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:34,468
What do you want?

796
01:46:35,343 --> 01:46:36,970
You have a lot of anger out there.

797
01:46:37,054 --> 01:46:40,098
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.

798
01:46:40,182 --> 01:46:45,020
If you can't scare them,
give them something to root for.

799
01:46:46,063 --> 01:46:47,064
Such as?

800
01:46:50,025 --> 01:46:51,693
Young love.

801
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:55,197
So you like an underdog?

802
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,573
Everyone likes an underdog.

803
01:46:56,656 --> 01:46:57,908
I don't.

804
01:46:59,618 --> 01:47:02,704
Have you been out there? 10? 11? 12?

805
01:47:04,331 --> 01:47:06,166
Not personally. No.

806
01:47:06,249 --> 01:47:07,667
Well, I have.

807
01:47:08,835 --> 01:47:10,796
There are lots of underdogs.

808
01:47:10,879 --> 01:47:12,547
Lots of coal, too.

809
01:47:12,881 --> 01:47:16,218
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.

810
01:47:18,053 --> 01:47:20,305
There are lots of underdogs.

811
01:47:21,306 --> 01:47:23,266
And I think if you could see them,

812
01:47:24,643 --> 01:47:27,145
you would not root for them either.

813
01:47:29,606 --> 01:47:30,982
I like you.

814
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:35,904
Be careful.

815
01:47:46,581 --> 01:47:48,834
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.

816
01:47:48,917 --> 01:47:53,755
<i>The regulations requiring a single victor
have been suspended.

817
01:47:53,839 --> 01:47:56,174
<i>From now on, two victors may be crowned,

818
01:47:56,258 --> 01:47:59,928
<i>if both originate from the same district.

819
01:48:00,011 --> 01:48:02,472
<i>This will be the only announcement.

820
01:48:03,849 --> 01:48:05,142
Peeta.

821
01:49:32,938 --> 01:49:34,356
What was it?

822
01:49:34,648 --> 01:49:35,941
A sword.

823
01:49:37,567 --> 01:49:39,110
It's bad?

824
01:49:40,237 --> 01:49:41,947
It's gonna be fine.

825
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:06,346
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.

826
01:50:13,937 --> 01:50:15,355
Why not?

827
01:50:35,583 --> 01:50:38,169
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

828
01:50:38,253 --> 01:50:40,213
They already found me.

829
01:50:44,342 --> 01:50:46,219
We'll just get you some medicine.

830
01:50:46,303 --> 01:50:48,138
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.

831
01:50:49,097 --> 01:50:50,348
We'll figure something out.

832
01:50:51,433 --> 01:50:52,767
Like what?

833
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:55,186
Something.

834
01:51:56,539 --> 01:51:59,084
Medicine?
- No. Soup.

835
01:51:59,918 --> 01:52:00,919
I'll do it.

836
01:52:11,596 --> 01:52:13,098
That's nice.

837
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,935
You fed me once.

838
01:52:20,021 --> 01:52:21,940
I think about that all the time.

839
01:52:23,733 --> 01:52:25,652
How I tossed you that bread.

840
01:52:25,735 --> 01:52:27,404
I should have gone to you.

841
01:52:27,487 --> 01:52:29,697
I should have just gone out in the rain and...

842
01:52:32,826 --> 01:52:34,285
You feel hot.

843
01:52:36,913 --> 01:52:38,957
I remember the first time I saw you.

844
01:52:40,208 --> 01:52:42,127
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.

845
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:46,714
And I remember when you sang
in the music assembly.

846
01:52:46,798 --> 01:52:49,175
<i>The teacher said,
"Who knows The Valley Song?

847
01:52:49,259 --> 01:52:51,386
And your hand shot straight up.

848
01:52:51,469 --> 01:52:52,554
Stop.

849
01:52:52,804 --> 01:52:56,641
After that,
I watched you going home every day.

850
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,655
Well, say something.

851
01:53:13,741 --> 01:53:16,161
I'm not good at saying something.

852
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:19,456
Then come here.

853
01:53:34,554 --> 01:53:36,431
Even if I don't make it...

854
01:53:37,348 --> 01:53:38,433
Stop it.

855
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:46,774

You're not going alone.

863
01:54:06,044 --> 01:54:08,129
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.

864
01:54:08,213 --> 01:54:10,965
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

865
01:54:11,049 --> 01:54:14,052
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?

866
01:54:16,012 --> 01:54:17,722
Why are you doing this?

867
01:54:36,241 --> 01:54:38,493
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.

868
01:54:50,588 --> 01:54:51,923
I'll stay.

869
01:56:53,711 --> 01:56:55,380
Where's lover boy?

870
01:56:58,049 --> 01:57:01,886
Oh, I see. You were gonna help him, right?

871
01:57:02,553 --> 01:57:07,141
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

872
01:57:07,725 --> 01:57:10,061
That little girl? What was her name again?

873
01:57:10,937 --> 01:57:12,021
Rue?

874
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:16,693
Yeah, well, we killed her.

875
01:57:17,402 --> 01:57:20,446
And now we're gonna kill you.

876
01:57:26,411 --> 01:57:27,704
You kill her?

877
01:57:27,787 --> 01:57:28,996
No!
- I heard you!

878
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:30,998
Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

879
01:57:31,082 --> 01:57:32,333
You said her name!

880
01:57:43,094 --> 01:57:44,262
Just this time, 12.

881
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,472
For Rue.

882
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:06,117
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.

883
01:58:06,409 --> 01:58:07,869
What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

884
01:58:07,952 --> 01:58:09,370
No, you're not. What happened?

885
01:58:09,579 --> 01:58:11,873
The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay.

886
01:58:11,956 --> 01:58:13,708
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

887
01:58:13,791 --> 01:58:15,293
You got worse.

888
01:58:19,464 --> 01:58:20,465
I'm sorry.

889
01:58:22,008 --> 01:58:23,551
You need some of that, too.

890
01:58:23,885 --> 01:58:25,136
I'm okay.

891
01:58:28,139 --> 01:58:29,807
That feels better.

892
01:58:31,434 --> 01:58:33,561
Okay. Now you.

893
01:58:33,853 --> 01:58:36,481
I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

894
01:59:41,337 --> 01:59:43,965
You're so much better.

895
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:51,013
I hardly feel anything.

896
01:59:52,223 --> 01:59:53,933
We could go home.

897
01:59:54,851 --> 01:59:57,353
We could. We're the only team left.

898
01:59:57,979 --> 01:59:59,605
We could go home.

899
02:00:04,402 --> 02:00:06,070
We know Thresh took off.

900
02:00:06,153 --> 02:00:07,947
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.

901
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:10,074
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

902
02:00:10,157 --> 02:00:12,577
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

903
02:00:15,288 --> 02:00:18,499
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

904
02:00:18,583 --> 02:00:20,209
Okay, I'll take the bow.

905
02:00:22,253 --> 02:00:24,755
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.

906
02:00:56,412 --> 02:00:57,538
Are you okay?

907
02:00:57,622 --> 02:00:59,415
I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.

908
02:00:59,498 --> 02:01:02,710
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

909
02:01:02,793 --> 02:01:03,920
I didn't know.

910
02:01:04,003 --> 02:01:06,339
You scared me to death. Damn you.

911
02:01:07,173 --> 02:01:08,507
I'm sorry.

912
02:01:09,926 --> 02:01:11,302
I'm sorry.

913
02:01:19,393 --> 02:01:21,562
I never even knew
she was following me.

914
02:01:21,646 --> 02:01:23,147
She's clever.

915
02:01:23,397 --> 02:01:24,774
Too clever.

916
02:01:26,108 --> 02:01:29,278
What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

917
02:01:35,368 --> 02:01:36,869
What time is it?

918
02:01:36,953 --> 02:01:38,371
A little after noon.

919
02:01:38,454 --> 02:01:39,538
Why is it getting so dark?

920
02:01:39,664 --> 02:01:41,290
Must be in a hurry to end it.

921
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:47,254
You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

922
02:01:48,631 --> 02:01:50,341
Well, that's great.

923
02:01:50,841 --> 02:01:52,218
Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

924
02:02:01,394 --> 02:02:04,939
That's it. That's excellent.

925
02:02:16,659 --> 02:02:18,327
Did you hear that?

926
02:02:50,651 --> 02:02:51,902
What was that?

927
02:02:53,029 --> 02:02:54,697
It's the finale.

928
02:06:18,984 --> 02:06:21,445
Go on. Shoot.

929
02:06:23,906 --> 02:06:26,116
Then we both go down and you'd win.

930
02:06:29,453 --> 02:06:33,874
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

931
02:06:38,879 --> 02:06:40,631
I always was, right?

932
02:06:43,050 --> 02:06:45,094
I didn't know that till now.

933
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:50,766
How is that? Is that what they want? Huh?

934
02:06:56,605 --> 02:06:57,982
I could still do this.

935
02:06:59,483 --> 02:07:01,360
I could still do this.

936
02:07:02,319 --> 02:07:04,196
One more kill.

937
02:07:06,448 --> 02:07:08,993
It's the only thing I know how to do.

938
02:07:09,326 --> 02:07:11,537
Bring pride to my district.

939
02:07:15,207 --> 02:07:17,001
Not that it matters.

940
02:08:32,743 --> 02:08:35,245
<i>Attention. Attention, Tributes.

941
02:08:35,412 --> 02:08:38,832
<i>There has been a slight rule change.

942
02:08:38,957 --> 02:08:40,834
<i>The previous revision,

943
02:08:40,918 --> 02:08:44,171
<i>allowing for two victors
from the same district,

944
02:08:44,254 --> 02:08:46,298
<i>has been revoked.

945
02:08:47,466 --> 02:08:51,595
<i>Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.

946
02:08:52,763 --> 02:08:55,766
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.

947
02:09:10,531 --> 02:09:11,782
Go ahead.

948
02:09:15,869 --> 02:09:17,746
One of us should go home.

949
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:21,959
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.

950
02:09:24,837 --> 02:09:26,255
They don't.

951
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:29,299
Why should they?

952
02:09:30,426 --> 02:09:32,136
Trust me.

953
02:09:53,282 --> 02:09:54,700
Together?

954
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:24,855
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the winners

955
02:10:25,731 --> 02:10:28,525
<i>of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

956
02:10:55,636 --> 02:10:57,554
<i>They're not happy with you.

957
02:10:58,222 --> 02:11:00,265
Why? Because I didn't die?

958
02:11:00,724 --> 02:11:02,518
Because you showed them up.

959
02:11:03,393 --> 02:11:06,188
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.

960
02:11:06,271 --> 02:11:08,482
I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

961
02:11:09,107 --> 02:11:12,236
This is serious. Not just for you.

962
02:11:12,653 --> 02:11:14,780
They don't take these things lightly.

963
02:12:06,665 --> 02:12:09,001
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.

964
02:12:09,084 --> 02:12:11,461
You were so in love with this boy

965
02:12:11,545 --> 02:12:15,632
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

966
02:12:15,799 --> 02:12:20,012
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

967
02:12:20,512 --> 02:12:24,975
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

968
02:12:29,646 --> 02:12:31,898
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

969
02:12:36,028 --> 02:12:38,572
I couldn't imagine life without him.

970
02:12:45,245 --> 02:12:46,872
And what about you, Peeta?

971
02:12:47,998 --> 02:12:49,708
She saved my life.

972
02:12:49,791 --> 02:12:50,834
We saved each other.

973
02:12:52,586 --> 02:12:57,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

974
02:12:57,174 --> 02:13:02,804
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

975
02:13:19,446 --> 02:13:20,947
Congratulations.

976
02:13:28,205 --> 02:13:29,623
What a lovely pin.

977
02:13:29,706 --> 02:13:32,084
Thank you. It's from my district.

978
02:13:32,834 --> 02:13:35,128
They must be very proud of you.

979
02:13:47,933 --> 02:13:50,352
So what happens when we get back?

980
02:13:51,728 --> 02:13:55,649
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

981
02:14:00,529 --> 02:14:02,406
I don't want to forget.
