1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
<i><b><u>Subtitles
~Adoni@~</u></b></i>

2
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,087
The Hovitos are near.

3
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,571
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

4
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,200
They're following us.

5
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,000
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

6
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:46,998
This is it.

7
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,566
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

8
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,850
A friend of yours?

9
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,814
A competitor.

10
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,084
He was good.

11
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:54,679
He was very, very good.

12
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,461
Senor... nobody's
come out of there alive.

13
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,416
Please...

14
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,119
Senor.

15
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:06,141
Stop.

16
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,150
Stay out of the light.

17
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:31,870
Forrestal.

18
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,910
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

19
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,559
That's what scares me.

20
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:41,594
Stay here.

21
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:43,552
If you insist, senor.

22
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,482
Give me the whip.

23
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:08,796
Throw me the idol.

24
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:12,446
No time to argue.

25
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:14,684
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

26
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,159
Give me the whip!

27
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:17,784
Adios, senor.

28
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,077
Adios, Satipo.

29
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,004
Dr. Jones.

30
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,030
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess...

31
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:45,657
...which I cannot take away.

32
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,801
And you thought I had given up.

33
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,406
You chose the wrong friends.

34
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,652
This time, it will cost you.

35
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,715
Too bad the Hovitos...

36
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:09,883
...don't know you the way I do,
Belloq.

37
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,446
Yes, too bad.

38
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,593
You could warn them...

39
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,185
...if only you spoke Hovitos.

40
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:02,395
Jock! Start the engines!

41
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,025
Get it up!

42
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,426
Jock, the engines!

43
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,668
Start the engines, Jock!

44
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:02,458
There's a big snake
in the plane, Jock!

45
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:05,212
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

46
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,452
I hate snakes, Jock!

47
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:08,601
I hate 'em!

48
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:11,869
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

49
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,956
"Neo," meaning "new"...

50
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:32,472
...and "lithic"...
I-T-H...

51
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:35,131
...I-C, meaning "stone".

52
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,761
All right, let's get back
to this site:

53
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:38,971
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

54
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:43,993
Contains a central pas-passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

55
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:52,022
...don't confuse that with
robbing, in which case we mean...

56
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,944
...the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

57
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,831
This site also demonstrates...

58
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:01,215
...one of the great dangers
of archaeology...

59
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,347
...not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place-

60
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,718
...no, I'm talking about folklore.

61
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,411
In this case,
local tradition held...

62
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,870
...that there was golden coffin
buried at the site...

63
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:14,327
...and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow...

64
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:17,150
...and the generally poor condition
of the find.

65
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,031
However, chamber three
was undisturbed...

66
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,039
...and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods...

67
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:23,454
...that were found in another...

68
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,757
...in the area, give us a r-

69
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:32,214
...reason to da-
to, uh, to-to date this...

70
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,849
...find as we have.

71
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,729
Any questions, then?

72
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:39,516
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

73
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:40,795
Um, don't forget-

74
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:45,502
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

75
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,576
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

76
00:13:57,472 --> 00:14:00,794
I had it, Marcus.
I had it in my hand.

77
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,571
-What happened?
-Guess.

78
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:06,968
-Belloq?
-You want to hear about it?

79
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:07,802
Not at all.

80
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,061
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum...

81
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,848
...conforms to
the International Treaty...

82
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,174
...for the Protection of Antiquities.

83
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,468
It's beautiful, Marcus. I can get it.
I got it all figured out.

84
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,015
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

85
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,199
I need $2,000. Look.
-Listen to me, old boy.

86
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,359
I brought some people to see you.
-Look.

87
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:25,215
I got these pieces.
They're good pieces, Marcus.

88
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,744
Look.
-Indiana...

89
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:30,274
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

90
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:31,810
Yes, they are nice.
-They're worth at least...

91
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,956
...the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

92
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,573
But the people
I brought are important...

93
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,850
...and they're waiting.
-What people?

94
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:39,596
Army Intelligence. They knew
you were coming before I did.

95
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,686
Seem to know everything.

96
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,810
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

97
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,662
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

98
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,188
What am I, in trouble?

99
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard
a great deal about you.

100
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:50,512
Have you?

101
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,800
Professor of archaeology,
expert on the occult...

102
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:59,370
...and, how does one say it?
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

103
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,643
That's one way of saying it.

104
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,140
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.

105
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,968
Thank you.

106
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,823
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

107
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:10,774
You studied under Professor Ravenwood
at the University of Chicago.

108
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,902
Yes, I did.

109
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,366
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

110
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,082
Well, just rumors, really.
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

111
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,082
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

112
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,374
We were friends, but...

113
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,412
...had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

114
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,616
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand...

115
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:33,012
...that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

116
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:34,622
I understand.

117
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:40,216
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections...

118
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,940
...intercepted a German communique...

119
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,184
...that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

120
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,971
-Now, to Cairo...
-See, over the last two years the Nazis...

121
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:50,435
...have had teams of archaeologists
running around the world...

122
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,988
...looking for all kinds
of religious artifacts.

123
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,937
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

124
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,493
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.

125
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,571
And, right now, apparently...

126
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:02,107
...there's some kind
of German archaeological dig...

127
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,137
...going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

128
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,757
Now, we've got some
information here...

129
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:08,097
...but we can't make anything
out of it and maybe you can.

130
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,972
"Tanis development proceeding.

131
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:15,537
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

132
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,365
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S. "

133
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,179
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

134
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,940
Just what does that mean to you,
Tanis?

135
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,414
-Well, it-
-The city of Tanis is one...

136
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:28,290
...of the possible resting places
of the Lost Ark.

137
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:29,752
The Lost Ark?

138
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,292
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.
The chest the Hebrews used...

139
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,809
...to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

140
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,995
What do you mean
"commandments"?

141
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,360
You talking about
the Ten Commandments?

142
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:38,294
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

143
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:39,547
The original stone tablets...

144
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:42,170
...that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed...

145
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,935
...if you believe
in that sort of thing.

146
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:46,997
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

147
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,217
-Well, I...
-Oh, look.

148
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:51,489
The Hebrews took the broken pieces
and put them in the Ark.

149
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:52,691
When they settled in Canaan...

150
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:55,421
...they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

151
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,713
-In Jerusalem.
-Where it stayed for many years.

152
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,281
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

153
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,086
Where?

154
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,213
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

155
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,891
-However, an Egyptian pharaoh...
-Shishak. -Yes.

156
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:08,891
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC...

157
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,809
...and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis...

158
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:15,077
...and hidden it in a secret chamber
called the Well of Souls.

159
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,606
Secret chamber?

160
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:18,039
However, about a year...

161
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,369
...after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt...

162
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,475
...the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert...

163
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:25,907
...in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

164
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:29,035
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

165
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,093
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

166
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,951
Now you seem to know...

167
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,305
...all about this Tanis, then.

168
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:40,175
No, no, not really.
Ravenwood is the real expert.

169
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,959
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

170
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,393
Collected some of its relics.

171
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,079
It was his obsession, really.

172
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,461
But he never found the city.

173
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,714
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

174
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:55,239
An American being mentioned
so prominently...

175
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:57,423
...in a secret Nazi cable.
-Oh, rubbish.

176
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:58,905
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

177
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,901
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

178
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,097
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking...

179
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,057
...for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra...

180
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,647
...and they think Abner's got it.

181
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,729
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

182
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,667
Well, the staff is just a stick,
I don't know, about this big...

183
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,297
...nobody really knows
for sure how high...

184
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:18,769
...and it's capped
with an elaborate headpiece...

185
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:22,407
...in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

186
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:25,557
And what you did was,
you take the staff...

187
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:26,911
...to a special room in Tanis...

188
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:29,946
...a map room with a miniature
of the city all laid out on the floor...

189
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,154
...and if you put the staff
in a certain place...

190
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,844
...at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here...

191
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,630
...and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

192
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,472
...and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

193
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,789
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

194
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,945
Which is exactly what
the Nazis are looking for.

195
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,743
What does this Ark look like?

196
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,685
There's a picture of it
right here.

197
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,429
That's it.

198
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,722
Good God.

199
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:08,127
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

200
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,776
Now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

201
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,751
Lightning...

202
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:15,712
...fire...

203
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:17,115
...power of God or something.

204
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:21,786
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.

205
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,832
Oh, yes.

206
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:25,343
The Bible speaks of the Ark
leveling mountains...

207
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,575
...and laying waste
to entire regions.

208
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,363
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

209
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,946
...is invincible.

210
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,173
You did it, didn't you?

211
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,557
They want you to go for it.

212
00:19:57,857 --> 00:19:58,921
Oh, Marcus!

213
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:02,843
They want you to get ahold of
the Ark before the Nazis do...

214
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,902
...and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

215
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,281
And the museum? The museum
gets the Ark when we're finished?

216
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:08,332
Oh, yes.

217
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,357
The Ark of the Covenant.

218
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:16,478
Nothing else has come close.

219
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,943
That thing represents everything...

220
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,832
...we got into archaeology for
in the first place.

221
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:27,422
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

222
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,922
I'm really rather envious.

223
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,278
I've got to locate Abner.

224
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:33,338
I think I know where to start.

225
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,640
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

226
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,758
Possibly.

227
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,565
Marion's the least
of your worries right now...

228
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,592
...believe me, Indy.

229
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:47,032
What do you mean?

230
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:50,559
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years...

231
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,066
...man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

232
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:56,640
Not something to be taken
lightly.

233
00:20:58,209 --> 00:20:59,858
No one knows its secrets.

234
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,801
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

235
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:07,304
Oh, Marcus.

236
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:08,893
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

237
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:09,838
You sound like my mother.

238
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:11,061
We've known each other
for a long time.

239
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,872
I don't believe in magic, a lot of
superstitious hocus-pocus.

240
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:15,737
I'm going after a find...

241
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,664
...of incredible
historical significance.

242
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:19,420
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

243
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,489
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

244
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,046
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

245
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:35,041
Thank you.

246
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:37,441
Give him space!

247
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:38,848
Go on, Regan!

248
00:24:26,986 --> 00:24:28,074
Hello, Marion.

249
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:36,536
Indiana Jones.

250
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,836
Always knew, someday...

251
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:42,827
...you'd come walking
back through my door.

252
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,156
I never doubted that.

253
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,182
Something made it inevitable.

254
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,938
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

255
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,268
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

256
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:54,936
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

257
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,840
I never meant to hurt you.

258
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:00,451
I was a child.
I was in love.

259
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,558
It was wrong and you knew it!

260
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,082
You knew what you were doing.

261
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,610
Now I do!
This is my place.

262
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:06,920
Get out!

263
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,329
I did what I did. You don't have
to be happy about it...

264
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,074
...but maybe we could
help each other out now.

265
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,913
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

266
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:19,155
Bronze piece, about this size...

267
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:20,823
...with a hole in it,
off-center, with a crystal.

268
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,714
You know the one I mean?

269
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:23,573
Yeah.

270
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:24,990
I know it.

271
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:26,615
Where's Abner?

272
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:28,482
Where's Abner?

273
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:30,872
Abner's dead.

274
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,253
Marion, I'm sorry.

275
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,104
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

276
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:43,030
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

277
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,848
Well, say it again, anyway.

278
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,584
Sorry.

279
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,283
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

280
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:50,735
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth...

281
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:52,010
...looking for
his little bits of junk.

282
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,420
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

283
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:57,316
Everybody's sorry for something.

284
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,784
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

285
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,611
You going to give it to me?
-Maybe.

286
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,294
I don't know where it is.

287
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,949
Well, maybe you could find it.

288
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,479
$ 3,000.

289
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:13,536
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

290
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:15,934
I can get you another 2
when we get to the States.

291
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,636
It's important, Marion.

292
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,392
Trust me.

293
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:24,570
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?

294
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,911
Come back tomorrow.

295
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:31,993
Why?

296
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:34,224
Because I said so, that's why.

297
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:44,923
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

298
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:52,063
Good evening, Fraulein.

299
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,170
The bar's closed.

300
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:57,144
We... We are...

301
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,072
...not thirsty.

302
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:00,414
What do you want?

303
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:03,330
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

304
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:07,017
Surely he told you there would be
other interested parties.

305
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,568
Must've slipped his mind.

306
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,548
The man is...
nefarious.

307
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:17,076
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

308
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,518
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

309
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:21,662
Oh, almost certainly.

310
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:24,142
Do you still have it?

311
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:30,708
No.

312
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,322
But I know where it is.

313
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,828
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

314
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:41,366
Your fire is dying here.

315
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,468
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

316
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:47,424
Listen, Herr Mac.

317
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:51,012
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with...

318
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,624
...but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

319
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:56,410
Fraulein Ravenwood...

320
00:28:57,615 --> 00:29:00,432
...let me show you
what I am used to.

321
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,847
Take your hands off me!

322
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:10,682
Take your lousy hands off!

323
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,785
Wait a minute.

324
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:21,309
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.
-That time is passed.

325
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:22,939
You don't need that.

326
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:25,914
Wait.

327
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,897
I'll tell you everything.

328
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,213
Yes, I know you will.

329
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:39,616
Let her go.

330
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:52,513
Whiskey.

331
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,654
Shoot them.

332
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:04,380
Shoot them both.

333
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,430
My medallion!

334
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:08,121
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten...

335
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:09,772
...how to show a lady
a good time!

336
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,436
-Boy, you're something!
-Yeah, I'll tell you what.

337
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,625
Until I get back my $5,000...

338
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:16,698
...you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

339
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:18,814
I'm your goddamn partner!

340
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:57,694
Cairo, city of the living.

341
00:32:57,762 --> 00:32:59,420
A paradise on earth.

342
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:02,299
Silence!

343
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,832
Why do you forget yourselves?

344
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:04,855
What is this?

345
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,297
Where did this animal come from?

346
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:11,548
Oh... oh, no.

347
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,419
Cute.

348
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,400
What an adorable creature.

349
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,337
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

350
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,832
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

351
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:33,790
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

352
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:35,833
You're the best digger in Egypt.

353
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:38,916
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

354
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:42,557
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

355
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:44,284
The excavation is enormous.

356
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:47,785
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

357
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:51,260
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

358
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,891
When did they find the map room?

359
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:54,314
Three days ago.

360
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:56,342
They have not one brain among them.

361
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:58,008
Except one.

362
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:01,114
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

363
00:34:02,755 --> 00:34:05,631
-What's his name?
-They call him "Bellosh".

364
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,130
Belloq. Belloq.

365
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:17,342
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

366
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:20,411
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

367
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:23,344
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

368
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,458
Who can tell us
about these markings?

369
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,416
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

370
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:35,184
Indy...

371
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:38,999
...there is something
that troubles me.

372
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:40,600
What is it?

373
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:43,740
The Ark.

374
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,014
If it is there, at Tanis...

375
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:49,336
...then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb.

376
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,764
Death has always surrounded it.

377
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:54,649
It is not of this earth.

378
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:56,758
Do we need the monkey, huh?

379
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,174
I'm surprised at you, Jones...

380
00:34:58,214 --> 00:34:59,999
...talking that way about our baby.

381
00:35:00,994 --> 00:35:03,584
He's got your looks, too.
-And your brains.

382
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:06,522
I noticed that.

383
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:09,016
She's a smart little thing-
smart.

384
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,077
Where you going?

385
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,805
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

386
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,665
Come on. Come on.
-Okay.

387
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:22,625
Marion.

388
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:23,639
What's this?

389
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:25,024
It's a date.

390
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,497
You eat 'em.

391
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,680
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with...

392
00:36:15,747 --> 00:36:17,602
...raise 8 or 9 kids,
like your friend Sallah?

393
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:18,649
Who says I haven't?

394
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:23,618
I do. Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

395
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:35,019
He said you were a bum.
-Oh, he's being generous.

396
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,176
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

397
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,788
You know, he loved you
like a son.

398
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:40,942
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

399
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,172
Not much, just you.

400
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,763
Marion, get out of here!

401
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:01,762
Duck!

402
00:37:42,412 --> 00:37:43,224
Right.

403
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,371
Marion!

404
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,723
Help! Over here, Indy!

405
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:56,378
Get out of the way!

406
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:57,793
Move! Move it!

407
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,281
Help me!

408
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,934
You can't do this to me!
I'm an American!

409
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:10,718
Indy!

410
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,703
Indiana Jones!
Help me, Jones!

411
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,876
-Jones!
-Marion!

412
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:44,253
Indy!

413
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,980
Marion.

414
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:05,524
Dr. Jones. Somebody
wants to talk to you.

415
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:30,783
You looking for me?

416
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:40,893
Belloq.

417
00:41:40,963 --> 00:41:42,370
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

418
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:44,290
I ought to kill you right now.

419
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:46,843
Not a very private place
for a murder.

420
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,358
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

421
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:52,288
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

422
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:55,978
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

423
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,864
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

424
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,083
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

425
00:42:11,523 --> 00:42:14,200
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

426
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:16,376
How odd that it should end
this way for us...

427
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,812
...after so many
stimulating encounters.

428
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,591
I almost regret it.

429
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:24,325
Where shall I find a new adversary
so close to my own level?

430
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,241
Try the local sewer.

431
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:30,781
You and I are very much alike.

432
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,304
Archaeology is our religion...

433
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:37,154
...yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

434
00:42:38,613 --> 00:42:41,122
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

435
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:44,401
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

436
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:48,127
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me...

437
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,236
...to push you out of the light.

438
00:42:50,308 --> 00:42:52,207
Now you're getting nasty.

439
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:55,281
You know it's true.

440
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:56,801
How nice.

441
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:58,559
Look at this.

442
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:00,838
It's worthless.

443
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:03,715
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

444
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:06,587
But I take it and bury it in the sand
for a thousand years...

445
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:09,668
...it becomes priceless...
like the Ark.

446
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:11,630
Men will kill for it.

447
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:14,124
Men like you and me.

448
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,537
What about your boss,
der Fuehrer?

449
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:20,581
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

450
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:22,802
All in good time.

451
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,728
When I am finished with it.

452
00:43:25,995 --> 00:43:28,725
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

453
00:43:29,603 --> 00:43:30,956
It's a transmitter.

454
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:34,137
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

455
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,201
And it's within my reach.

456
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:39,492
You want to talk to God?

457
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,884
Let's go see Him together.

458
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:45,083
I've got nothing better to do.

459
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:48,098
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

460
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:50,010
Uncle Indy, come home now!

461
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:54,105
Next time, Indiana Jones...

462
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,668
...it'll take more than children
to save you.

463
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,329
Uncle Indy!

464
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,364
I thought I would
find you there.

465
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,541
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

466
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:28,472
-Marion's dead.
-Yes, I know.

467
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:29,927
And me!
And me!

468
00:44:29,988 --> 00:44:30,890
I'm sorry.

469
00:44:31,908 --> 00:44:33,566
Life goes on, Indy.

470
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:35,359
There is the proof.

471
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:40,513
I have much to tell you.

472
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,012
First we will take them home...

473
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,636
...and then I will take you
to the old man.

474
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:35,708
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

475
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,383
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

476
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,311
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

477
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,567
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes.

478
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,568
A headpiece like that one...

479
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:47,364
...except round the edges,
which were rougher.

480
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,818
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal...

481
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:53,859
...and surrounding
the crystal, on one side...

482
00:45:53,899 --> 00:45:56,180
...there were raised markings,
just like that one.

483
00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:00,377
They made their calculations
in the map room?

484
00:46:00,617 --> 00:46:04,503
This morning. Belloq and
the boss German, Dietrich.

485
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:07,036
When they came out
of the map room...

486
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:09,279
...they gave us a new spot
in which to dig...

487
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:10,786
...out away from the camp.

488
00:46:12,195 --> 00:46:13,783
The Well of the Souls, huh?

489
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,996
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.

490
00:46:17,595 --> 00:46:18,515
Sit down.

491
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:20,598
Come, sit down.

492
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:21,534
What is it?

493
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:24,892
This is a warning...

494
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:27,421
...not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

495
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:28,891
What about the height
of the staff, though?

496
00:46:28,963 --> 00:46:32,385
Did Belloq get it off of here?
-Yes. It is here.

497
00:46:32,451 --> 00:46:36,303
This were the old way,
this mean six kadam high.

498
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:37,820
-About 72 inches.
-Wait!

499
00:46:41,252 --> 00:46:44,001
And take back one kadam...

500
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,664
...to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is.

501
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:01,593
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

502
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:03,347
Are you absolutely sure?

503
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:06,717
Belloq's staff is too long.

504
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:09,439
They're digging
in the wrong place.

505
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:14,076
<i>~I am the monarch of the sea</i>

506
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:15,637
<i>~I am the ruler of the-</i>

507
00:47:26,403 --> 00:47:27,533
Bad dates.

508
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,011
I told you not to be premature
in your communique to Berlin.

509
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,388
Archaeology is not
an exact science.

510
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,570
It does not deal
in time schedules.

511
00:47:52,595 --> 00:47:54,393
The fuehrer is not
a patient man.

512
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:57,439
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

513
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:00,546
You led me to believe...
Nothing! I made no promises.

514
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,499
I only said
it looked very favorable.

515
00:48:02,564 --> 00:48:05,695
Besides, with the information
in our possession...

516
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:07,618
...my calculations were correct.

517
00:48:07,683 --> 00:48:09,439
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

518
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:13,123
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

519
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,097
At about 9:00 in the morning.

520
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:16,740
Not much time, then.

521
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,040
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

522
00:48:19,108 --> 00:48:21,906
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

523
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:23,330
Let's go, come on.

524
00:52:19,795 --> 00:52:20,795
Sallah.

525
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:23,499
Sallah!

526
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:32,396
They're here.

527
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:44,783
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

528
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:46,347
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

529
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:50,937
If you want water,
I will get you water.

530
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:52,285
No problem, no problem.

531
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:08,666
I thought you were dead.
They must have switched baskets.

532
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:14,212
Are you hurt?

533
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:16,265
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

534
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,211
They're gonna be back at any minute.

535
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,584
Cut me loose.

536
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:22,371
Quick.
They keep asking about you.

537
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:23,301
What you know.

538
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,040
What's wrong?

539
00:53:29,387 --> 00:53:31,576
Cut me loose.
-I know where the Ark is, Marion.

540
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,213
The Ark's here?

541
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,643
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

542
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:36,992
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

543
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:38,074
If I take you out of here now...

544
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:39,554
...they'll start combing
the place for us.

545
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:40,993
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

546
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:43,645
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!

547
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:45,328
Marion, I hate to do this...

548
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:47,964
...but if you don't sit still
and keep quiet...

549
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:49,772
...this whole thing
is going to be shot.

550
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:52,858
I'll be back to get you.

551
00:53:52,931 --> 00:53:54,589
Jones, what's the matter?

552
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,898
That's it.

553
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:43,616
Who knows?
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting...

554
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:45,464
...in some antechamber
for us to discover.

555
00:54:46,004 --> 00:54:48,694
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

556
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,001
Perhaps...

557
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,057
-The girl can help us.
-My feeling exactly.

558
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:55,719
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

559
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,259
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

560
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:00,601
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

561
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:04,915
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.

562
00:55:05,411 --> 00:55:06,659
But it needn't concern you.

563
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,959
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

564
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:16,066
Heil Hitler.

565
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:37,187
Indy! Here!
We've hit stone!

566
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:42,754
Clear it off.

567
00:56:42,804 --> 00:56:44,188
Come on, find the edges.

568
00:57:00,227 --> 00:57:01,820
Good, good, good.

569
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:03,385
You see, Indy? You see?

570
00:57:03,459 --> 00:57:05,161
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

571
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,967
As a team, boys! As a team!

572
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:09,655
Push!

573
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:16,403
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.

574
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,017
Good, good, that's it.

575
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:19,011
Watch your toes.

576
00:57:26,596 --> 00:57:28,369
Carefully, carefully!

577
00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:40,803
Sorry, Indy.

578
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:43,642
Indy...

579
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:46,663
...why does the floor move?

580
00:57:48,227 --> 00:57:49,655
Give me your torch.

581
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:20,565
Snakes.

582
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:22,875
Why did it have to be snakes?

583
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,415
Asps.

584
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:29,981
Very dangerous.

585
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:32,777
You go first.

586
00:58:51,797 --> 00:58:53,274
If you're trying to escape on foot...

587
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:56,121
...the desert is three weeks
in every direction...

588
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,654
...so please, eat something.

589
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:07,132
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

590
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:09,403
Yeah. Whose idea was it?
No food, no water.

591
00:59:09,475 --> 00:59:11,624
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

592
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:14,158
At this particular time
and place, to do my work...

593
00:59:14,198 --> 00:59:15,816
...they are necessary evils.

594
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,761
They're not my friends.

595
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:20,206
However, with the
right connections...

596
00:59:20,612 --> 00:59:24,284
...even in this part of the world
we are not entirely uncivilized.

597
00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:27,686
It's beautiful.

598
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:30,460
I would very much like
to see you in it.

599
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,190
I'll bet you would.

600
00:59:38,627 --> 00:59:39,636
All right.

601
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,802
What have you got to drink
around here?

602
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,353
We don't have that much time.

603
00:59:54,812 --> 00:59:56,376
Soon they will come to harm you...

604
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,713
...and I will not be able
to stop them...

605
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:01,176
...unless you are able
to give me something...

606
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:02,450
...to placate them.

607
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:05,646
Some piece of information...

608
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:08,946
...which I can use
to protect you from them.

609
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:10,910
I've already told you
everything I know.

610
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,843
I have no loyalty to Jones.

611
01:00:13,588 --> 01:00:15,430
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

612
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,153
Marion, you are beautiful.

613
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:31,001
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

614
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:36,376
Steadily.

615
01:00:36,452 --> 01:00:38,339
Steadily. Whoa!

616
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:42,683
Down.

617
01:00:42,756 --> 01:00:44,161
Carefully, carefully!

618
01:00:44,612 --> 01:00:46,002
You all right, Indy?

619
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,881
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

620
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:13,405
I told you it will be all right.

621
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,777
Sallah, get down here!

622
01:01:58,275 --> 01:01:59,619
You pour.

623
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,755
Oh, that's good.

624
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,262
What is this stuff, Rene?

625
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:05,923
I grew up with this.

626
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:08,997
It's my family label.

627
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,476
Well... I have to be
going now, Rene.

628
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:44,687
I like you, Rene, very much.

629
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,911
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

630
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,935
We meet again, Fraulein.

631
01:04:55,396 --> 01:04:57,753
You Americans,
you're all the same.

632
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,100
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

633
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,398
Now...

634
01:05:36,644 --> 01:05:38,760
...what shall we talk about?

635
01:06:53,796 --> 01:06:56,013
All right... take it up!

636
01:06:56,604 --> 01:06:57,604
Easy!

637
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:01,790
You're as stubborn as that girl.

638
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,921
You like her too much, I think.

639
01:07:04,212 --> 01:07:07,232
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

640
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,397
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... China cup.

641
01:07:17,156 --> 01:07:18,880
Kernel!
Wake your men!

642
01:07:18,949 --> 01:07:20,405
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

643
01:07:21,092 --> 01:07:22,398
Go on, get out of here.

644
01:07:42,212 --> 01:07:44,025
-Sallah!
-Hello!

645
01:07:44,988 --> 01:07:46,002
Hello!

646
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,557
Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are
you doing in such a nasty place?

647
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,615
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

648
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:56,240
Thank you, my friend, but I think
we are all very comfortable up here.

649
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,790
That's right, isn't it?

650
01:07:58,212 --> 01:08:01,010
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

651
01:08:02,005 --> 01:08:03,750
So, once again, Jones...

652
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:06,554
...what was briefly yours
is now mine.

653
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:10,036
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

654
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:12,121
You're about to become
a permanent addition...

655
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:14,060
...to this archaeological find.

656
01:08:14,403 --> 01:08:17,716
Who knows? In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

657
01:08:19,412 --> 01:08:20,751
Son of a bitch.

658
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,977
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

659
01:08:23,002 --> 01:08:24,888
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

660
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:28,791
But I do not wish to leave you
down in that awful place all alone.

661
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:30,672
Slimy pig, you let me go!

662
01:08:31,397 --> 01:08:32,404
Stop it!

663
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:36,190
Marion!

664
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:37,852
Hang on.

665
01:08:38,788 --> 01:08:39,803
Don't...

666
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:41,483
-Indy!
-Don't fall!

667
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:43,713
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

668
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,437
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

669
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:58,107
Snakes!

670
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:00,930
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

671
01:09:02,532 --> 01:09:04,644
-The girl was mine!
-She's of no use to us.

672
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,617
Only our mission
for the fuehrer matters.

673
01:09:09,404 --> 01:09:12,574
I wonder sometimes, Monsieur
if you have that clearly in mind.

674
01:09:13,381 --> 01:09:15,016
It was not to be, cherie.

675
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,959
You bastard!
I'll get you for this!

676
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:19,402
Indiana Jones...

677
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:21,764
...adieu.

678
01:09:34,028 --> 01:09:35,028
No!

679
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,758
Take this.

680
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:47,520
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

681
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,404
Thank you.

682
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:51,074
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

683
01:09:54,044 --> 01:09:55,059
Indy!

684
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:56,399
Jesus!

685
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,606
Where did you get this?
From him?

686
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,297
I was trying to escape.

687
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,442
No thanks to you.

688
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:05,763
How hard were you trying?

689
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:07,942
-Well, where the hell were you?
-Watch it, watch it.

690
01:10:07,992 --> 01:10:10,410
-What are you doing?
-For the fire!

691
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,654
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

692
01:10:14,821 --> 01:10:15,764
I'm working on it!

693
01:10:15,804 --> 01:10:17,670
Well, whatever you're doing,
do it faster!

694
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:25,812
-Where are you going?
-Through that wall.

695
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:28,930
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

696
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:30,490
What do you mean by that?

697
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,208
Indy!

698
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,500
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

699
01:11:10,188 --> 01:11:11,188
Indy!

700
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:13,986
Here we go!
Get ready!

701
01:11:14,372 --> 01:11:17,208
Indy, the torch is going out!

702
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:58,181
Indy?

703
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:18,996
Marion!

704
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:21,707
Look.

705
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:00,796
They're going to fly it
out of here.

706
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:04,012
When that Ark gets loaded we're
already gonna be on the plane.

707
01:13:08,205 --> 01:13:12,131
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

708
01:13:12,397 --> 01:13:13,397
To the Ark.

709
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,277
When we are very far
from here. Not with you.

710
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:10,028
Hey, you now.
Come here!

711
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:12,393
Come here!

712
01:15:15,589 --> 01:15:16,799
Indy!

713
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:07,460
Stay with the Ark!

714
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:14,017
Look out!

715
01:16:24,389 --> 01:16:25,375
Oh, my God.

716
01:16:25,613 --> 01:16:26,617
Marion.

717
01:16:26,645 --> 01:16:29,214
In here!
Up here!

718
01:16:31,813 --> 01:16:32,827
Indy, come on!

719
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:33,948
Hold on!

720
01:16:34,021 --> 01:16:35,909
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

721
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:40,668
It's stuck! Indy!

722
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,372
I can't push it off!

723
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:13,026
It's stuck!

724
01:17:13,093 --> 01:17:14,467
-Turn it! Turn it!
-It's stuck!

725
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:15,613
Turn it there!

726
01:17:15,685 --> 01:17:17,212
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

727
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:39,748
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

728
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,252
Have it put on the truck.

729
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:43,268
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

730
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,241
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

731
01:17:52,485 --> 01:17:53,485
Jones.

732
01:17:59,621 --> 01:18:00,898
Holy smoke, my friends...

733
01:18:00,965 --> 01:18:03,134
...I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

734
01:18:04,453 --> 01:18:05,882
Indy, we have no time.

735
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:07,233
If you still want the Ark...

736
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:09,634
...it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

737
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:11,490
Truck?

738
01:18:11,557 --> 01:18:12,702
What truck?

739
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:40,363
Let's go!

740
01:18:48,798 --> 01:18:49,958
Get back to Cairo.

741
01:18:49,982 --> 01:18:51,700
Get us some transport
to England.

742
01:18:52,389 --> 01:18:54,659
Boat, plane, anything.

743
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,019
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.

744
01:18:57,034 --> 01:18:59,267
I'm going after that truck.
-How?

745
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,318
I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.

746
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:48,709
He's there!

747
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:40,832
Idiot!

748
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:25,918
Everything at last
has been arranged.

749
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:27,380
-The Ark?
-Is on board.

750
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,378
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

751
01:26:29,418 --> 01:26:31,610
Or what is left of you.
-You trust these guys?

752
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:32,410
Yes.

753
01:26:34,582 --> 01:26:35,755
Mr. Katanga.

754
01:26:39,602 --> 01:26:41,700
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

755
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:43,724
They are my family.

756
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:46,843
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

757
01:26:47,206 --> 01:26:48,966
My cabin is theirs.

758
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,600
Mr. Jones...

759
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:53,414
...I've heard a lot about you, sir.

760
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:56,490
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

761
01:27:01,206 --> 01:27:02,402
Goodbye.

762
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,760
Look out for each other.

763
01:27:07,213 --> 01:27:08,994
I am already missing you.

764
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:12,997
You're my good friend.

765
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:16,606
Sallah.

766
01:27:20,398 --> 01:27:21,828
That is for Fayah...

767
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,110
...that is for your children
and this is for you.

768
01:27:32,032 --> 01:27:33,032
Thank you.

769

774
01:28:07,414 --> 01:28:08,604
I'm cleaning up.

775
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:11,418
Where'd you get that?

776
01:28:11,942 --> 01:28:13,144
From him.

777
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,387
Who him?

778
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,955
Katanga. I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman...

779
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:18,600
...ever to travel
with these pirates.

780
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,200
It's lovely.

781
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,164
Yeah?

782
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,716
-Yeah.
-Really?

783
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:25,190
Yeah.

784
01:28:36,742 --> 01:28:37,942
What'd you say?

785
01:28:44,806 --> 01:28:46,570
Wait...
I don't need any help.

786
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:48,092
You know you do.

787
01:28:50,814 --> 01:28:52,976
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

788
01:28:53,016 --> 01:28:56,562
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

789
01:29:01,806 --> 01:29:02,979
You are...

790
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:05,743
Please, I don't need a nurse.

791
01:29:05,744 --> 01:29:07,468
I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.

792
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,772
Marion, leave me alone.

793
01:29:08,806 --> 01:29:10,018
-What is this here?
-Go away.

794
01:29:10,022 --> 01:29:11,764
Yes, it hurts.

795
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,502
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

796
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:18,186
Here.

797
01:29:24,182 --> 01:29:25,182
Here.

798
01:29:33,982 --> 01:29:35,579
This isn't too bad.

799
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:45,790
Here.

800
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:06,965
Jones...

801
01:30:09,575 --> 01:30:10,789
Jones!

802
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:16,156
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

803
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,212
What is it?

804
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,804
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

805
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,520
-What's happening?
-We have most important friends.

806
01:30:59,591 --> 01:31:00,602
Holy shit.

807
01:31:02,822 --> 01:31:04,670
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.

808
01:31:04,742 --> 01:31:07,365
We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, my friend, go.

809
01:31:20,402 --> 01:31:22,620
-Where is Dr. Jones?
-What's the big idea?

810
01:31:22,807 --> 01:31:23,808
Let go!

811
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:30,033
Don't you touch me.

812
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:14,786
What about Jones?

813
01:32:14,854 --> 01:32:16,370
There's no trace yet, sir.

814
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:17,988
Jones is dead.

815
01:32:20,793 --> 01:32:22,194
I killed him.

816
01:32:22,598 --> 01:32:24,406
He was of no use to us.

817
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:27,838
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

818
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,378
She'll bring a very good price.

819
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:36,569
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...

820
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:38,574
...if it's your goal,
go in peace with it...

821
01:32:38,599 --> 01:32:40,977
...but leave us the girl.
It would reduce our loss on this trip.

822
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,083
Savage!

823
01:32:43,595 --> 01:32:45,749
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

824
01:32:46,216 --> 01:32:47,796
We will take what we wish.

825
01:32:48,423 --> 01:32:51,924
And then decide whether or not
to blow your ship from the water.

826
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,781
The girl goes with me.

827
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:58,376
She'll be part
of my compensation.

828
01:32:58,417 --> 01:33:00,106
I'm sure your fuehrer
would approve.

829
01:33:01,006 --> 01:33:04,078
If she fails to please me,
you may do with her as you wish.

830
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:06,982
I will waste
no more time with her now.

831
01:33:07,623 --> 01:33:08,670
Excuse me.

832
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,788
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.
I've looked everywhere.

833
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:29,190
He's got to be here somewhere.

834
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:30,942
Look again.

835
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:34,468
-I found him.
-Where?

836
01:33:34,518 --> 01:33:35,276
There.

837
01:35:56,007 --> 01:35:57,826
The altar has been
prepared in accordance...

838
01:35:57,895 --> 01:36:00,166
...with your radio instructions, sir.
-Good.

839
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,908
Take the Ark there immediately.

840
01:36:04,404 --> 01:36:05,457
Monsieur...

841
01:36:07,847 --> 01:36:12,445
...I am uncomfortable with the thought
of this Jewish ritual.

842
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:15,196
Are you sure it's necessary?

843
01:36:16,182 --> 01:36:17,771
Let me ask you this.

844
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:21,756
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin...

845
01:36:21,796 --> 01:36:23,386
...for your fuehrer?

846
01:36:23,815 --> 01:36:27,418
Finding out, only then if the sacred
pieces of the Covenant are inside?

847
01:36:28,004 --> 01:36:31,148
Knowing, only then whether you have
accomplished your mission...

848
01:36:31,183 --> 01:36:34,138
...and obtained the one true Ark?

849
01:37:59,015 --> 01:38:00,015
Hello!

850
01:38:02,759 --> 01:38:03,752
Jones.

851
01:38:05,127 --> 01:38:06,309
Jones!

852
01:38:06,415 --> 01:38:08,606
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.

853
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:17,072
Your persistence
surprises even me.

854
01:38:18,408 --> 01:38:20,610
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

855
01:38:20,998 --> 01:38:21,998
Dr. Jones...

856
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,948
...surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

857
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:30,320
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

858
01:38:30,351 --> 01:38:31,934
All I want is the girl.

859
01:38:37,007 --> 01:38:38,508
If we refuse?

860
01:38:39,215 --> 01:38:41,709
Then your fuehrer has no prize.

861
01:38:42,567 --> 01:38:45,052
Okay, stand back.
All of you, stand back.

862
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:46,334
Stand back.

863
01:38:46,727 --> 01:38:48,258
Okay, Jones.

864
01:38:48,283 --> 01:38:49,492
You win!

865
01:38:50,783 --> 01:38:52,357
Blow it up.

866
01:38:57,863 --> 01:38:59,068
Yes, blow it up!

867
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:02,918
Blow it back to God.

868
01:39:03,615 --> 01:39:07,206
All your life has been spent in
pursuit of archaeological relics.

869
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:11,402
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

870
01:39:11,991 --> 01:39:14,581
You want to see it open
as well as I.

871
01:39:16,295 --> 01:39:17,392
Indiana...

872
01:39:18,415 --> 01:39:20,774
...we are simply passing
through history.

873
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:23,586
This...

874
01:39:26,183 --> 01:39:27,973
This is history.

875
01:39:37,191 --> 01:39:38,808
Do as you will.

876
01:42:07,802 --> 01:42:10,941
Marion, don't look at it.
Shut your eyes, Marion.

877
01:42:11,015 --> 01:42:12,886
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

878
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:41,985
It's beautiful!

879
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:53,199
Indy?

880
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:55,682
Don't look, Marion!
Keep your eyes shut!

881
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:11,583
Marion.

882
01:44:42,983 --> 01:44:45,786
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you...

883
01:44:46,152 --> 01:44:50,174
...and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

884
01:44:50,194 --> 01:44:53,196
Oh, the money's fine.
The situation's totally unacceptable.

885
01:44:53,224 --> 01:44:55,578
Well, gentlemen I guess that
just about wraps it up.

886
01:44:55,618 --> 01:44:57,645
Where is the Ark?

887
01:44:59,004 --> 01:45:00,812
I thought we'd settled that.

888
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,544
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

889
01:45:03,609 --> 01:45:04,320
From whom?

890
01:45:04,392 --> 01:45:07,206
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power...

891
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:09,167
...and it has to be researched.

892
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:12,407
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody.

893
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:13,520
Dr. Jones.

894
01:45:13,991 --> 01:45:17,007
We have top men
working on it right now.

895
01:45:18,407 --> 01:45:19,520
Who?

896
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:23,331
Top men.

897
01:45:26,472 --> 01:45:27,770
Hey, what happened?

898
01:45:28,391 --> 01:45:29,766
You don't look very happy.

899
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,874
-Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
-What'd they say?

900
01:45:33,415 --> 01:45:35,424
They don't know
what they've got there.

901
01:45:35,783 --> 01:45:37,766
Well, I know what I've got here.

902
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:40,210
Come on.

903
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,701
I'll buy you a drink.

904
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:44,748
You know...

905
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,698
...a drink?

906
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:35,400
