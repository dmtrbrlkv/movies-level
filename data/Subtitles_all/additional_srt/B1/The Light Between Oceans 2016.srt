1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
25.000 English
from BluRay

2
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,110
<i>I'm just looking to get</i>
<i>away from things for a little while.</i>

3
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,070
Well, it's no paradise out on that island.

4
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,190
Just want to make sure
you know what you're in for.

5
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,950
All due respect, Mr. Coughlan,

6
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,430
it's not likely to be tougher
than the Western Front.

7
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,030
Oh, you're probably right about that.

8
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,990
You pay your own passage
to every posting.

9
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,990
You're a relief worker
so you don't get holidays.

10
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,430
I understand you're a single man.

11
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,790
No family.

12
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,470
So, that's a slight concern.

13
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,630
Wouldn't normally send
a single man to Janus.

14
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,950
It's pretty remote

15
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,950
and wife and family
can be a great practical help,

16
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,110
not just a comfort.

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,910
But, seeing it's only temporary,

18
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,750
you leave for Port Partageuse

19
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,990
- in two days.

20
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,350
From there you'll be
shipped off to Janus.

21
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,230
Welcome to Commonwealth Lighthouse Service.

22
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,710
Proud to have a man
who served our country

23
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,350
with such distinction amongst our ranks.

24
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:38,841
The Light Between Oceans (2016)

25
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,270
Ah! Mr. Sherbourne, right on time.

26
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,430
Come in, do.

27
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,950
Thank you very much.

28
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,390
Welcome to Partageuse.

29
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,550
Let me introduce you.

30
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,070
This'll probably be
the guest of honor.

31
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,230
This is Mr. Tom Sherbourne,
our new lightkeeper.

32
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,270
How do you do?

33
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,310
Cyril and Bertha Chipper.

34
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,390
How lovely to meet you.

35
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,670
Uh, Bill Graysmark.

36
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,030
- His wife, Violet...
- How do you do?

37
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,630
- And their daughter...
- How do you do?

38
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,230
Oh, she's around here somewhere.
Well...

39
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,150
Mr. Sherbourne, can I tempt you?

40
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,350
Thank you very much.

41
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,990
Oh, Tom, that lighthouse of yours
will be guiding ships

42
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,190
on the Northern Hemisphere

43
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,630
bringing wealth and prosperity

44
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,550
- to our land.

45
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,550
God knows we need it after this war.

46
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,230
It's been costly enough
in more ways than one, eh?

47
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,470
Sir.

48
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,350
You think you're up for it?

49
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,470
We'll soon find out.

50
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,630
Oh, please.
The last thing the poor man needs

51
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,190
are your tales of doom and gloom.

52
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,750
Told you she'd turn up.

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,350
This is Isabel Graysmark.

54
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,270
Isabel, meet Mr. Sherbourne.

55
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,510
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Sherbourne.

56
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,230
Ms. Graysmark.

57
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,830
<i>Janus isn't</i>
<i>a particularly popular posting.</i>

58
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,070
You'll be the only living man

59
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,350
for a good part of
100 miles in any direction.

60
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,830
I don't suppose they told you
why the position became available?

61
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,310
Temporarily available.

62
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,590
Trimble will be back,

63
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,830
and good as new in six months.

64
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,430
Just needs a bit of
recuperation time, that's all.

65
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,670
- Is that all?
- Uh...

66
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,030
Did they inform you, Mr. Sherbourne?

67
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,150
I don't believe anyone told me
about the specifics.

68
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,390
Doesn't surprise me.

69
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,870
Trimble Docherty

70
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,550
worked the light for nearly six years.

71
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,590
Without incident!

72
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,230
- Without incident.
- Mmm.

73
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,310
Then he caused a stir

74
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,990
when he reported that his wife has been
signaling the passing ships.

75
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,310
Unacceptable, of course,
and for two reasons.

76
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,710
Signaling passing ships
had long been forbidden precisely...

77
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,790
Obviously, he knows that.

78
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,790
What was the other reason?

79
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,910
His wife has been dead for two years.

80
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,510
Simple case of cabin fever

81
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,870
plus a dose of grief, that's all.

82
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,830
Mr. Sherbourne should have been informed.

83
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,350
Long before he signed
on the dotted line.

84
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,030
I certainly appreciate your telling me.

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,230
And I hope Trimble
recovers from whatever is ailing him.

86
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,470
As for the isolation,

87
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,750
I feel I'm prepared for it.

88
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,350
In fact, after France,

89
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,750
the idea of a little time alone,

90
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,790
I welcome it.

91
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,190
Hear, hear.

92
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,470
Well said, Mr. Sherbourne.

93
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,310
Well said. Here's to the future.

94
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,790
To the future.
To the future.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,550
We wish you all the best.

96
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,630
All the best.

97
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,430
- All the best.
- All the best.

98
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,910
Please look us up next time
you're coming back through.

99
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,790
Been a pleasure meeting you all.

100
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,110
I think he was
a very impressive young man.

101
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,510
Oh, yes.
Well, he's just come home...

102
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,110
Too late to change your mind now, son.

103
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,310
Six months is nothing!

104
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,510
If you're not trying to hold your breath.

105
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,030
Goodbye, Tom.

106
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,030
Well done, Sherbourne.

107
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,710
You look as fit and well
after three months

108
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,110
as any keeper I've seen.

109
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,870
Gentlemen.

110
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,350
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

111
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,630
Where's Trimble?

112
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,750
Hasluck wants to talk to you
about that on shore.

113
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,110
Tom, thank you for coming.

114
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,950
Now, you'll probably wonder
why we called you here.

115
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,430
We all thought

116
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,390
Trimble was on the way
to a swift recovery.

117
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,070
But, he threw himself over
the cliff-face at Albany.

118
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,310
We haven't bothered to look elsewhere
to fill the position.

119
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,830
You've proved yourself
more than capable

120
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,270
and we'd like to offer you
a three year contract on the post.

121
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,190
We're confident you won't let us down.

122
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,870
Mr. Sherbourne.

123
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,910
What a pleasant surprise!

124
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,390
Good afternoon.

125
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,110
I thought you were on your island.

126
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,070
Uh, Captain Hasluck offered me a job.

127
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,150
More of a permanent type post.

128
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,430
How wonderful.
I want to hear all about it.

129
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,710
Won't you stay for lunch?

130
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,790
That'd be very nice.

131
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,950
Thank you.

132
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,150
<i>You must have really</i>
<i>impressed the Commonwealth.</i>

133
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,470
Offering you the post
after only three months.

134
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,510
I doubt there were
many vying for the job.

135
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,710
Not a lot of men
on the market these days.

136
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,030
Unfortunately, you're right, sir.

137
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,470
How long till you have to go back?

138
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,230
Couple of days.

139
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,190
What are your plans?

140
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,190
I'm sure there are a lot of details

141
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,910
that he has to tidy up
before he ships off.

142
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,430
He's offered to take me
on a picnic tomorrow.

143
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,070
Oh, what a nice idea.

144
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,430
- Picnic?
- Yes.

145
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,990
Hmm.

146
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,510
I think that's wonderful.

147
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,830
What's it like out there?

148
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,550
It's quiet.

149
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,990
There's time to think.

150
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,550
You get lonely?

151
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,350
Too busy. There's always
something that needs fixing.

152
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,790
You like it?

153
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,590
You don't actually talk a lot, do you?

154
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,310
Do you ask out all the light keepers
that go out to Janus?

155
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,830
All?

156
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,750
You're the first new one in years.

157
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,190
<i>I can tell you lots about me.</i>

158
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,670
My mom taught me the piano.

159
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,670
You still play?

160
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,270
Not that well.

161
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,310
My brothers used to
tease me awfully when I played.

162
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,550
I lost both of them.

163
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,110
In the War.

164
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,510
Just must be
so confusing for my parents.

165
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,470
I mean, if a wife loses a husband

166
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,590
she becomes a widow,

167
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,110
but if a parent loses a child

168
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,430
there's no special label for it.

169
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,310
You're still a mother or father.

170
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,750
Even if you no longer have a child.

171
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,790
Sometimes I wonder,

172
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,870
if I'm still technically a sister

173
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,590
now when my brothers are gone.

174
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,030
How long were you there, in the War?

175
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,550
Nearly four years.

176
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,630
You poor thing.

177
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,110
Must have made you numb.

178
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,990
My feet.

179
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,910
Made my feet numb,
more often than not.

180
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,830
Frozen mud will do that to you.

181
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,110
What about your family?

182
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,270
Tell me about your parents.

183
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,950
My mother's dead.

184
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,630
What about your father?

185
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,870
No love lost there.

186
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,550
Was he strict with you?

187
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,630
Strict doesn't begin to describe it.

188
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,550
Still, though,

189
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,390
made army discipline easy.

190
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,470
I suppose it made it easier

191
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,470
being over there,
knowing there'd be no one

192
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,950
heartbroken if they got the telegram.

193
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,110
Don't say such a thing.

194
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,430
Well, you asked.

195
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,030
Sometimes it's good
to leave the past in the past.

196
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,710
So if I can't talk about the past,

197
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,990
am I allowed to talk about the future?

198
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,190
We can't rightly talk about the future
if you think about it.

199
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,390
We can only talk about
what we imagine or wish for.

200
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,510
It's not the same thing.

201
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,950
You're impossible.

202
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,550
So what do you wish for, then?

203
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,110
Life.

204
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,750
That'll do me, I reckon.

205
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,310
Take me out to Janus with you.

206
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,910
- What?

207
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,310
I want to see it.

208
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,230
I want to see
where you hide yourself away.

209
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,430
I'm afraid that that would be
against Commonwealth rules.

210
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,350
The only woman allowed on Janus
is the keeper's wife.

211
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,150
Then marry me.

212
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,310
What are you laughing at?

213
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,710
You'd have to have rocks in your head
to want to marry me.

214
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,430
Better get you back home.

215
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,390
Or they'll have the troopers after me.

216
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,710
Come on.

217
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,190
Will you write to me?

218
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,150
Of course.

219
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,910
<i>Dearest Isabel.</i>

220
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:59,830
<i>Each day and each night</i>

221
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,990
<i>when I look out across the ocean</i>

222
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,070
<i>I try to see you</i>

223
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,510
<i>standing on the pier.</i>

224
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,510
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about our time together,</i>

225
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,150
<i>and what you said.</i>

226
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,310
<i>You were right.</i>

227
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,270
<i>I've been around so much death</i>

228
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,390
<i>for so long, that it has made me numb.</i>

229
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,870
<i>I suppose that's why I came to Janus</i>

230
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,350
<i>because out here</i>
<i>there is no one to hurt.</i>

231
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,110
<i>Out here, I am only responsible</i>
<i>for the light.</i>

232
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,030
<i>For many years, everything</i>
<i>I touched would fade away.</i>

233
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,190
<i>And you are so full of life it scares me.</i>

234
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,550
Isabel. A parcel!

235
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,950
<i>I admire your spirit too much</i>
<i>to let it be clouded by my darkness.</i>

236
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,710
- From Tom.

237
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,470
<i>Yet, I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

238
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,830
<i>And the time spent with you</i>
<i>allowed me to feel again.</i>

239
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,950
<i>And for that, I thank you.</i>

240
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,950
<i>And I'm forever grateful.</i>

241
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,430
<i>Yours, Tom.</i>

242
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,510
<i>Dearest Tom.</i>

243
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,590
<i>I've received your beautiful letter.</i>

244
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,470
<i>Thank you.</i>

245
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,950
<i>Thank you for opening up to me.</i>

246
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,710
<i>I know how hard that must be for you.</i>

247
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,150
<i>I also know how hard it is to have lost.</i>

248
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,470
<i>But we all have to get on with life.</i>

249
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,790
<i>And you still have a light inside of you.</i>

250
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,430
<i>I've seen it.</i>

251
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,110
<i>And it shines just as bright</i>

252
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,310
<i>as the stars in your sky.</i>

253
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,830
<i>Isabel, I'm not too good with words.</i>

254
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,590
<i>Never have been.</i>

255
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,750
<i>I guess I never knew it was all right</i>
<i>to talk about the things I felt.</i>

256
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,070
<i>So, here it goes,</i>

257
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,710
<i>I'd love to show you</i>
<i>my island and my life.</i>

258
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,710
<i>And if you do decide to come,</i>

259
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,670
<i>I promise I will take care of you always.</i>

260
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,750
<i>And I'll do my very best</i>
<i>to be a good husband.</i>

261
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,870
<i>I hope you will like Janus</i>
<i>as much as I do.</i>

262
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,350
<i>Tom, when I first saw you,</i>

263
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,310
<i>I felt like I knew you,</i>

264
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,230
<i>and I couldn't stop</i>
<i>seeing my life with you.</i>

265
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,030
<i>And building a family together.</i>

266
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,230
<i>One that isn't stuck</i>
<i>in the pain of the past.</i>

267
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,350
It's very pretty.

268
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,550
<i>- And so,</i>

269
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,710
<i>if you're asking me if my</i>
<i>proposition still stands...</i>

270
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,390
<i>then my answer is "yes."</i>

271
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,230
<i>"Yes. A thousand times, yes."</i>

272
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,110
Please stand.

273
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,070
Have everybody's attention, please!

274
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,150
I know I'm not in front of
my own school assembly now,

275
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,510
so I shall keep it short.

276
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,510
Tom.

277
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,150
Don't interrupt me, Tom.

278
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,590
Tom, it is clear to anyone who meets you

279
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,270
that you're talkative...

280
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,830
But you are also a very good man.

281
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,990
Now that's a relief because you have
the most precious thing in our lives.

282
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,670
Take good care of her.
Protect our little girl.

283
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,710
She's all we have.

284
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,670
And who knows?
Maybe, in the near future,

285
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,630
a new generation will come along.

286
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,350
So, here's to Isabel and Tom.

287
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,270
To Isabel and Tom!

288
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,590
- Isabel and Tom!

289
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,950
<i>There once was a swagman</i>

290
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,950
<i>Camped by a billabong</i>

291
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,150
<i>Under the shade of the coolibah tree</i>

292
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,390
<i>And he sang as he looked</i>

293
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,390
<i>At the waters and the meadows</i>

294
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,230
<i>Who'll come a-waltzing,</i>
<i>Matilda with me</i>

295
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,630
<i>Who'll come a-Waltzing</i>
<i>Matilda, my darling</i>

296
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,550
<i>Who'll come a-waltzing,</i>
<i>Matilda with me</i>

297
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,310
<i>Waltzing Matilda</i>
<i>and needing a billabag</i>

298
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,070
<i>Who'll come a-waltzing,</i>
<i>Matilda with me</i>

299
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,310
<i>Who'll come a-Waltzing</i>
<i>Matilda, my darling</i>

300
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,870
Welcome to Janus.

301
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,190
You didn't tell me.

302
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,550
It came with the place.

303
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,990
Probably twice as old.

304
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,870
- It doesn't play.

305
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,630
- More of a relic.

306
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,550
Right now.

307
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,430
Concentrate.

308
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,270
You...

309
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,830
You make me...

310
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,030
You make me feel...

311
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,390
<i>...at peace.</i>

312
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,990
Very strange.

313
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,110
- You look like a baby.
- Mmm.

314
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,190
Come on, big guy. Rufus.

315
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,910
Rufus. Come on.

316
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,830
<i>You know Janus is where</i>
<i>the word January comes from.</i>

317
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,110
<i>Named after the same god</i>
<i>as this island.</i>

318
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,110
<i>He's got two faces, back to back.</i>

319
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,110
<i>Always looking both ways.</i>

320
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,270
<i>Torn between two ways</i>
<i>of seeing things.</i>

321
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,190
<i>January looks forward to the new year</i>

322
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,070
<i>and back to the old.</i>

323
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,630
And this island looks in the direction
of two different oceans.

324
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,830
You're going to make our baby so clever.

325
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,070
How do you know it's just one?

326
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,950
Maybe it's twins. Or triplets.

327
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,110
Can you hear anything?

328
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,510
Are they talking yet?

329
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,670
They're saying I need
to carry their mum to bed

330
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,750
before the night gets too cold.

331
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,190
Mmm.

332
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,870
Storm looks like it's not kidding around.

333
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,910
Where are you going?

334
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,150
I have to stay with the light.

335
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,350
Can I come with you?

336
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,750
Darling, you'll be safe down here.

337
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,150
You'll be all right. I promise.

338
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,990
Stay inside.

339
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,230
Tom.

340
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,030
Tom!

341
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,950
Tom!

342
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,230
Tom!

343
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,150
Tom!

344
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,070
Tom! Tom!

345
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,830
Isabel? Isabel. Isabel!

346
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,150
I'm sorry.

347
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,710
Don't you do this.

348
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,270
I'm so, so sorry.

349
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,990
Oh, my God.

350
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,430
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

351
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,990
<i>It's no one's fault.</i>

352
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,150
I'll go send for a doctor.

353
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,790
What's the point of a doctor?

354
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,070
The baby's gone.

355
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,830
There's you to consider.

356
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,150
No.

357
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,750
It's much too embarrassing.

358
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,670
One day,

359
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,390
when you've got five kids
running around

360
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,430
getting under your feet,

361
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,230
this'll all feel like a dream.

362
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,230
Jesus.

363
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,350
How dare you!

364
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,950
How dare I?

365
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,270
I told you I didn't need a doctor,

366
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,310
but you went behind my back?

367
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,430
No, Isabel, it's not...

368
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,270
I'm not having him
poking and prodding around,

369
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,230
telling me nothing I don't already know.

370
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,550
Wait, Isabel.

371
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,830
Isabel, wait! It's not...

372
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,910
Isabel!

373
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,030
How'd she take it, Tom?
Pleased as punch, I bet.

374
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,070
Looks like I'm making sandwiches for lunch.

375
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,990
If you don't mind...

376
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,990
I'm just trying to make your piano
play a bit nicer for you.

377
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,030
Get some of these noises out of it.

378
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,550
Hey, hey. Come here.

379
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,790
So much for surprises, huh?

380
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,590
We can try again.

381
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,550
That sounded beautiful, darling.

382
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,230
Izz?

383
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,030
Izz?

384
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,390
Oh, no.

385
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,550
What is it?

386
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,390
What's wrong?

387
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,950
I felt...

388
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,230
All right. I felt...

389
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,950
You all right?

390
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,190
Fine.

391
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,430
Not now.

392
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,670
Woof!

393
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,950
No!

394
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,870
Isabel?

395
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,790
I think it's coming!

396
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,230
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

397
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,150
That's it. That's it.

398
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,190
It's too early.

399
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,310
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

400
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,150
What do I...

401
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,510
Make it stop!

402
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,230
What do you want me to do?

403
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,030
No! No!

404
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,190
Isabel, what do you want me to do?

405
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,750
- Tell me. Sit down.
- Oh no, God, no!

406
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,830
- It's too early...
- Shh...

407
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,430
It's too early! No!

408
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,270
Tell me what to do, Izz. What can I do?

409
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,230
- What should I do?

410
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,390
Let me get you...

411
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,990
Tell me what to do, Izz!

412
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,550
What should I do?

413
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,590
Save it!

414
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,590
You have to save it, Tom!

415
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,390
- You have to save her.
- Oh...

416
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,110
Isabel!

417
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,630
Boat!

418
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,270
It's a boat!

419
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,110
Someone in it!

420
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,390
There's a man!

421
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,670
There's a body!

422
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,310
I'm here. I'm here, baby.

423
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,190
He's dead.

424
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,710
Get the baby to the house.

425
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,470
Where have you been?

426
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,310
Where have you been?

427
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,910
You're safe now.

428
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,670
There. You're safe now.

429
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,030
It's a girl.

430
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,750
She was starving.

431
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,430
Thank God we found her in time.

432
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,350
- Shh...

433
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,630
I'll send a signal,
get them to send a boat for the body...

434
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,190
- and for Miss Muffet here.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

435
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,630
The poor man's not going
to get any worse now.

436
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,190
And this little chicken's had
quite enough boats for the moment.

437
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,750
Can we leave it a while?

438
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,390
Give her a chance to catch her breath.

439
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,790
It's all got to go in the log, sweetheart.

440
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,750
You know I have to report
everything straight away.

441
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,190
What if the boat belongs to a ship?

442
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,430
It's a dinghy,

443
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,190
not a lifeboat.

444
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,390
Izz?

445
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,150
- Shh...

446
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:14,550
You talk a lot.

447
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,430
First thing in the morning, then.

448
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,110
As soon as the light's out.

449
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,510
You're safe now.

450
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,390
Tom?

451
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,750
Where are you going?

452
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,350
To send a signal.

453
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,710
It can't just be a coincidence

454
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,070
that she showed up so soon after...

455
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,510
Careful now.

456
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,190
She's a lovely baby,

457
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,390
but she doesn't belong to us.
We can't keep her.

458
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,710
Why not?

459
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,670
Who's to know she's here?

460
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,830
When Ralph and Bluey get here

461
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:03,950
in a few weeks, they'll know for a start.

462
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,190
No one will know she's not ours.

463
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,990
They all think I'm expecting.

464
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,670
They'll just be surprised
that she arrived early.

465
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,710
What about the dead man
in the boat?

466
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,670
Don't tell anyone about him.

467
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,270
We've done nothing wrong

468
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,070
except give shelter to a helpless baby.

469
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,750
We can give the man a decent burial.

470
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,550
It isn't even up to me.

471
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,590
I have to report it.

472
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,670
It's my duty, it's why I'm here.

473
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,870
I know, I know.

474
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,830
I know. Listen, listen, listen.

475
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:44,950
I know.

476
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,990
I know how much the rules mean to you.

477
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,070
What are they for?

478
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,150
They're to save lives.

479
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,950
That's all I'm saying.

480
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,790
Save this life.

481
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:57,990
She's here

482
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,630
and she needs us.

483
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,350
We can help her.

484
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,430
We're not doing anything wrong.

485
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,630
That's just it.

486
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,270
We don't need to do anything wrong.

487
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,910
If we report it now,

488
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,470
we can apply to adopt her.

489
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,070
She can be ours.

490
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,030
- Adopt her? No.
- Yes.

491
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,830
They'll never send
a baby to a lighthouse

492
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,270
in the middle of nowhere.

493
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,670
No doctor, no school, no church.

494
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,350
They'll never give her to us.

495
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,790
They'll ship her to
some dreadful orphanage.

496
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,910
Please don't do that to her.

497
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,070
Please.

498
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,790
I know...

499
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:09,470
You're going to be a wonderful father.

500
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,110
We can save her.

501
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,470
She's here.

502
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,110
She's here.

503
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,830
Our baby.

504
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,190
Baby.

505
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,670
<i>Hey!</i>

506
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,390
Congratulations, son.

507
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,950
Just marvelous! Just marvelous.

508
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,230
Thanks, Ralph.

509
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,910
Well, well, well!
Well done.

510
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,990
Thanks, Bluey.

511
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,510
Good on you both.
Can't you just tell?

512
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,470
Nothing makes a girl bloom
like having a little one.

513
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,870
Oh, what a lovely thing.

514
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,390
That's Lucy.

515
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,070
<i>You...</i>

516
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,550
were the talk of every woman
in Partageuse.

517
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,310
Having your baby way out here,

518
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,870
- on your own.

519
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,270
I hope Tom wasn't too useless.

520
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,070
I couldn't ask for a better husband.

521
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,030
She's a real pretty little thing.

522
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,750
She's got Tom's nose though, eh?

523
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,950
I don't know if Tom's nose

524
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,390
is what you want a baby girl to have.

525
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,910
Well, Mr. Sherbourne,
I'll need your signature on some papers.

526
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,310
Right-o.

527
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,390
To the office, Captain.

528
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,590
Hey!

529
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,550
Ralph, um, can you hang on a tick?

530
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,950
I must write thank you's to my parents.

531
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,030
What do you want?

532
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,510
They'll love to hear from you

533
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,870
since they won't see you till next year.

534
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,070
You're a lucky one, aren't you?

535
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,550
Look at this.
Hey! Getting a fancy rattle.

536
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,030
Fit for an angel. Yeah?

537
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,110
Hey.

538
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,990
<i>Come, come!</i>

539
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,230

550
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,870

551
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,990
<i>Welcome back.</i>

552
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,230
Oh, darling!

553
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:57,350
What now? We'll go and see.

554
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,350
What are you going to call me?

555
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,630
This is grandpa.

556
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,270
- Grandad or Grandpa.
- And Grammy.

557
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,310
How about Papa?

558
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,990
And Grammy? Can I have a little kiss?

559
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,790
<i>For what we are about to receive,</i>

560
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,270
<i>may the Lord make us truly thankful,</i>

561
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,630
<i>and may we always be mindful</i>
<i>of the needs of others.</i>

562
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,790
<i>Thank you, Lord for the blessings</i>

563
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,150
<i>that have been bestowed</i>
<i>upon this family,</i>

564
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,630
<i>in the form of Lucy Sherbourne.</i>

565
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,910
Amen.

566
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,630
Amen.
Amen.

567
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,590
- No more tatoes.
- Now, potatoes?

568
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:29,790
I want tatoes.

569
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:30,830
You want more tatoes?

570
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,750
She has a very good appetite.

571
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,790
Mmm-hmm.

572
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,190
That's grandmother's cooking.
Very nice.

573
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,430
You're so funny.

574
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,150
You've got a very good appetite, Lucy.

575
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,830
- Oh, she loves that!

576
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,630
She is an absolute joy.

577
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,470
I enjoy it much better than London.

578
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,230
Vicar!

579
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,590
Where's the Vicar gone?

580
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,630
- What?

581
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,030
Sleeping off the night before,

582
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,870
- if I know him.

583
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:09,310
Blue, son, run over to the Vicar's.

584
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,510
Tell him he's got a christening
and he's running late.

585
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,630
- Are we early?
- All right.

586
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,790
- No. He's not there.

587
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:14,870
He's not there.

588
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,750
Not there.
You can sit down.

589
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,470
Come on, let's sit down.

590
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,110
You're big girl, now.

591
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,270
- Darling.
- Getting heavy.

592
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,910
I went to Albany yesterday...

593
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,510
All in God's good time.
Oh, I'm sorry.

594
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:26,910
Hopeless!

595
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,230
Bluey will find him. No worry.

596
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,070
I've never understood
why they want a kitten.

597
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,870
No, you should always be honest.

598
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,510
I'm getting weak.
Couldn't agree more...

599
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,430
I'm getting weak, Ralph.

600
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,030
Tom?

601
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,070
Tom?

602
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,070
Tom!

603
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,630
There you are. Tom, we found him.

604
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,150
The Vicar.

605
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:29,870
I found him.

606
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,950
Ye have brought this child

607
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,590
here to be baptized.

608
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,070
Ye have prayed
that our Lord, Jesus Christ,

609
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,390
would vouchsafe to receive her.

610
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,510
To release her of her sins,

611
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,230
to sanctify her with the Holy Ghost.

612
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,990
<i>To give her the kingdom of heaven</i>

613
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,790
<i>and everlasting life.</i>

614
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,190
<i>Wherefore, after this promise</i>
<i>made by Christ,</i>

615
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:04,350
<i>this infant must also renounce</i>
<i>the devil and all his works.</i>

616
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,270
<i>And constantly believe God's holy word</i>

617
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,110
<i>and obediently keep His commandments.</i>

618
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,910
Quite a day for it, eh?

619
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,070
You all right, my friend?

620
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,310
Saw this memorial today.
The church yard.

621
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,430
Shook me up a bit.

622
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,550
Some German fellow and his baby.

623
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:43,910
Yeah.

624
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,110
Terrible business.

625
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,790
Lost at sea in a rowing boat.

626
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,470
Shocking.
Happened a couple of years ago.

627
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:01,390
Did you ever hear of Hannah Potts?

628
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,710
She's the daughter of the wealthiest man
around these parts.

629
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,790
Yeah, she married
this German fellow named Frank.

630
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,270
Her father wouldn't talk to her again
after that.

631
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:18,270
Then, one night, Hannah and Frank

632
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,710
were harassed by some of the locals.

633
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,790
I suppose it was
because he was German,

634
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:31,030
and they'd lost family during the war.

635
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,670
Anyway, they put the fright in him,

636
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:38,550
and he grabbed the baby
and jumped into a rowing boat.

637
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:41,870
You know his weak heart
must have given way,

638
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,230
and wind and the current
swept him out to sea.

639
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,670
That poor little infant.

640
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,470
Never should have happened.

641
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,470
- Shocking.

642
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,790
Makes you realize how lucky we are.

643
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:09,950
Little dip.

644
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,110
Ooh!

645
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,510
She looks positively surly.

646
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,830
Where?

647
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,510
Gwen!

648
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,110
Gwen!

649
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,310
Read.

650
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,270
<i>Read it.</i>

651
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,750
No, it's not much to go on, I'm afraid.

652
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,270
And that's it, is it?

653
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,630
You're going to sit there and do nothing

654
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,990
while someone knows
that my girl is alive.

655
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,790
Is that right?

656
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:49,990
I'll file all the...

657
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,190
- File reports?
- Reports.

658
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,070
- Mmm-hmm.
- And, yes.

659
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:57,590
And then I'll let you know of any news
that comes at hand.

660
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,630
News! We've got to
get up and look for her.

661
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:01,990
Leave, leave the notebook, ma'am.

662
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,030
No!

663
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,430
<i>Why would someone bother</i>

664
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:10,390
to write a letter like this
if it weren't true?

665
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,950
I'll double the reward.

666
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,390
I'll make it 2,000 guineas.

667
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:23,830
Anyone knows anything out there,
we'll soon find out.

668
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:36,790
"Your husband is at peace in God's hands."

669
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,790
"Your husband

670
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,270
"is at peace

671
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:47,590
"in God's hands."

672
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:53,910
<i>"Your husband is at peace in God's hands."</i>

673
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,830
<i>I miss you, Frank.</i>

674
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,830
It's only poetry, you see?

675
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,190
Poetry my foot.

676
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,990
It's not a decent word
come out of their mouths.

677
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,270
I heard we had a German in town
working in the bakery,

678
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,830
but I didn't think you'd be bold enough

679
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,350
to rub it in our faces like this.

680
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:12,710
Please keep the book, Mrs. McPhee.

681
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,190
I'm very sorry if I caused
anyone any offense.

682
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,790
Excuse me.

683
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:31,990
<i>Excuse me!</i>

684
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,310
<i>Are you out of your mind, girl?</i>

685
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,950
<i>Marrying a German?</i>

686
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:53,670
Bloody baker.

687
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,350
He's a good man.

688
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,990
Not that that would make
a difference to you anyway.

689
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,030
You marry this man,
it will be without my blessing.

690
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,790
<i>And without my money.</i>

691
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,350
God, the father, God, the son,

692
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:09,750
God the Holy Ghost.

693
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:13,510
Bless, preserve and keep you.

694
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:18,070
<i>The Lord mercifully with</i>
<i>his favor look upon you.</i>

695
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,150
<i>And so fill you with all</i>

696
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,150
<i>spiritual benediction and grace,</i>

697
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:25,230
<i>that you may so</i>
<i>live together in this life.</i>

698
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:29,510
<i>That in the world to come,</i>
<i>you may have life everlasting.</i>

699
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,110
<i>That's me.</i>

700
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,150
That's you.

701
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,670
I was very tiny.

702
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:00,910
And who's that?

703
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,510
- Dadda.
- That's Dadda.

704
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:11,350
And look at all the people
that live in here.

705
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:13,270
This is a house. See?

706
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,430
All the little animals. Here.

707
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,590
Look. See them all moving in there?

708
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,430
See, Lucy? See?

709
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,670
Hey! Look at me!

710
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,830
I see you!

711
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,270
One
One.

712
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,710
- And then two.
- Two.

713
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:28,310
Then comes...

714
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:29,750
Three.

715
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,190
Four.

716
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,590
Move!

717
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:34,870
Try it again.

718
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:38,990
In your house. Get. In.

719
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,430
They're not working.

720
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,350
- Take the last one.

721
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,790
All right, where are we going to put it?

722
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:45,830
<i>Juice?</i>

723
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,070
Oh, it smells so good.

724
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:49,510
Can I pour it in?

725
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:53,110
Okay. It's very strong
so just a tiny drop.

726
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,390
How many words do you know
that sound like goat?

727
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,670
I have no idea.

728
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,390
What? What? What?

729
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,070
- I don't know.
- What was that?

730
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,070
- What was that?

731
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,390
You're lying.

732
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,910
Is that a snake?

733
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,070
Let's step on it!

734
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:22,390
<i>Make a wish.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

735
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,350
A book!

736
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,790
Read it, Dadda.

737
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,190
"For my Dadda. With love...

738
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:38,790
"Forever and ever and ever
and ever and ever and ever.

739
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:41,430
"And ever and ever and ever and ever,

740
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:44,550
"and ever and ever and ever
and ever and ever."

741
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,590
It's the loveliest present I ever had.

742
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,590
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

743
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,630
Mmm-hmm.

744
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,750
<i>I know you have all traveled</i>

745
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,750
<i>over great distances today</i>

746
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:25,030
<i>to celebrate a very special thing.</i>
<i>The light.</i>

747
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,950
<i>And I want to thank you all</i>

748
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,910
<i>for coming here today to honor it.</i>

749
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:35,030
40 years ago today,
Janus light was first lit.

750
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:40,550
And for 40 years it's been a beacon
of security in the face of danger.

751
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:43,910
There are some very important
people who are here today

752
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,750
that I'd like to personally thank.

753
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:46,870
Firstly.

754
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:50,950
This model was paid for
by our local benefactor,

755
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:52,710
Mr. Septimus Potts.

756
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,910
Mr. Potts.

757
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,510
Please put your hands together

758
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,990
for Mr. Potts and his
two charming daughters,

759
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:59,590
Hannah and Gwen.

760
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,950
Thank you!

761
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,350
Thank you very much.

762
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,110
How wonderful. How wonderful.

763
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,110
And today, we have the honor of having

764
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:10,230
three of our last five lightkeepers
here with us.

765
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,430
Including our current keeper
Mr. Thomas Sherbourne.

766
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:15,510
Who also served his country

767
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:18,550
with honor and bravery in the Great War.

768
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,870
And I'm sure Tom would be delighted

769
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:24,790
to say a few words
about life on Janus today.

770
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,710
Good on you, Tommy.

771
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,390
Up you come, Tom.

772
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,990
Don't be shy, Tom. Don't be shy.

773
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,470
Thank you, Tom.

774
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,310
Wasn't expecting this.

775
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,910
Life in Janus today,

776
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,510
you can never tell what the tide is going
to bring in from one day to the next.

777
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,430
Everything that two oceans fling at us.

778
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:20,150
Anything you can think of.

779
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,390
Can't hear you, son.

780
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,230
Is he all right?

781
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,590
Is he okay?

782
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,310
Many of you have...

783
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,790
Your brothers, your sons, your fathers.

784
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:37,070
Didn't come back from the war.

785
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:42,990
I don't know why God
picked me to survive it.

786
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,270
I don't know what right
I have to be given life

787
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,630
while it is taken from others.

788
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,310
Speak up, Tommy.

789
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,350
What I really need to tell you is

790
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:18,350
I just try to keep the light burning
for whoever might need it. Thank you.

791
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,710
Thank you. Thank you, Tom.

792
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:27,150
That was heartfelt, thank you indeed.

793
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,310
Now ladies and gentlemen,

794
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,630
I think it's time for a hot cup of tea.
Some fresh air.

795
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,470
Please take the opportunity to come

796
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:34,870
and look at this marvelous, marvelous...

797
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,270
You all right?

798
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,030
Not too keen on surprises.

799
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:43,590
I know he was a bit nervous.

800
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,670
Of course! Well, he wasn't expecting it.

801
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:49,950
Speaking in public's terrifying
for a lot of people, really terrifying.

802
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:51,030
Oh!

803
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,830
Gwen, you know
Isabel Sherbourne, don't you?

804
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:54,990
Isabel.
Graysmark.

805
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,150
- Oh, yes.
- Isabel Graysmark.

806
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,270
Hello. I know who you are.

807
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,470
Nice to meet you. Isabel.

808
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:59,550
This is my sister, Hannah.

809
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:00,710
Nice to meet you.

810
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:01,710
Hello. Very nice to meet you.

811
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:02,790
Hello.

812
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,390
Isabel's married to Mr. Sherbourne

813
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,670
who gave the speech just now.

814
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,870
Oh.

815
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,470
What's your name?

816
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:09,830
Lucy.

817
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,790
Lucy, how old are you?

818
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:12,950
Four.

819
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,990
Very pleased with the turnout.
Very pleased.

820
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,550
Of course, Janus is very
important to the people here.

821
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,230
Oh, it's a stamp on the world, isn't it?

822
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:25,310
Is that a treasure box to put things in?

823
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,590
This is a watch.

824
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,630
It's a little clock that tells the time.

825
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:31,950
What's the name of your doll?

826
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,150
- Mavis.
- Mavis?

827
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:35,070
And she's five, isn't she?

828
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,230
Let me tell them.

829
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,230
- Oh!
- Um...

830
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:39,990
My doll is five.

831
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,070
Yes.

832
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,270
This is Hannah and Gwen Potts.

833
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,350
And she goes to flower school.

834
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,470
- Hello.
- How do you do?

835
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,670
- This is Tom, my husband.
- Hello.

836
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,110
We secretly pick a flower to
put in our vegetable garden.

837
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,550
Hannah, this is Tom, my husband.

838
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,790
- Hello.
- How do you do?

839
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,190
I, uh...

840
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:58,550
I liked what you said earlier
in your speech

841
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,590
about the light being there
for whoever needed it.

842
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,070
Could I...

843
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,270
Ask you something, Mr. Sherbourne?

844
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:12,990
Yes.

845
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:20,310
Do ships ever rescue people
far out at sea?

846
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:26,270
Have you ever heard
of little boats being picked up

847
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,910
and survivors

848
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:31,030
taken to the other side
of the world, perhaps?

849
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:38,110
When it comes to the ocean,
anything's possible.

850
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,710
I see.

851
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,870
Well, I'm ready to go home.

852
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,910
Gwen, um, do you think
you can stay here and look after Dad?

853
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:53,230
It was lovely to meet you.

854
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:54,710
It was lovely to meet you, too.

855
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:56,150
Bye.

856
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,350
Bye.

857
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,790
You have a very lovely daughter.

858
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:01,910
Excuse me.

859
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:06,390
I'm sorry about that.

860
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:11,070
My sister had a terrible tragedy
a few years ago.

861
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,750
Her family were lost at sea.

862
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:18,070
Her husband and their baby daughter

863
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:21,510
who would have been
your girl's age by now.

864
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:22,790
I better go see if she's all right.

865
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,030
It was lovely meeting you both.

866
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:06,230
<i>I don't know what came over her.</i>

867
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,910
<i>Must be sheer exhaustion.</i>

868
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,350
<i>She doesn't really get a break</i>
<i>on the island, does she now?</i>

869
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:18,910
I think you should leave
Lucy and Isabel here

870
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,910
while you go back.

871
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:26,390
The isolation...

872
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:30,430
It's too much for her.
You must see that.

873
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,750
And Lucy needs her mother.

874
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,950
We have to tell people now.

875
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,830
It's over.

876
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:06,710
It's too late.

877
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,630
You saw her.

878
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:13,430
You saw what we've done to her.

879
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:14,870
We can't let it go on.

880
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,430
We can't do it anymore.
We have to do what's right.

881
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,470
We have to do what's right for Lucy.

882
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,830
Not for you, not for me, not for some

883
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,150
stranger, but for Lucy.

884
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:33,030
It's her mother.

885
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,870
I'm her mother.

886
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:40,470
To Lucy, I'm her mother.

887
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:28,950
Good boy!

888
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:56,310
<i>It's my baby's rattle.</i>

889
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,030
My dad bought it for Grace.

890
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,510
You sure it's the same one?

891
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,070
Yes, Sergeant.

892
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,390
Quite sure.

893
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,790
I want this investigated, Sergeant.

894
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,630
Store boat's coming.

895
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:25,350
Where's Lucy?

896
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,710
Playing.

897
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:31,350
Why's the boat coming?
It's only been a week.

898
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,830
Do what I say and you'll be all right.

899
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,270
I'll tell them it was me.

900
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,590
That it was all my idea,

901
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,070
and I forced you to go along with it.

902
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,230
What are you talking about?

903
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,270
You'll be safe.
I'll protect you, I promise.

904
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:50,870
What have you done?

905
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:55,230
I had to do something.

906
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,870
- What have you...
- It's over.

907
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,830
What have you done? Why?

908
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:07,030
Lucy...

909
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,350
You don't love me.

910
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,950
Isabel. Stop.

911
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:12,470
Let me go.

912
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,190
It's over.

913
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:22,390
Let me go. Let me go.

914
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:26,110
You have to tell them it was me.

915
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,430
Thomas Edward Sherbourne.

916
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:45,910
Sergeant Knuckey. Partageuse police.

917
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:50,110
Here about Frank Roennfeldt
and his daughter, Grace.

918
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,990
Where's the child?

919
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:11,230
Out back.

920
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:17,750
This was sent to
Mrs. Roennfeldt last week.

921
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:20,790
Most probably by the same person
who sent her a letter

922
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,790
getting on three years ago.

923
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,910
She doesn't know anything about it.

924
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:27,710
Talk to me, not her.

925
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:35,030
I'll want to ask you a few questions

926
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:37,270
when we're finished
talking with your husband.

927
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:38,910
Don't stray too far.

928
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:47,550
I set it up for you, Mama.

929
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,190
I made the tea for you.

930
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:58,390
Maybe after tea,
maybe there could be something

931
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,590
in there that we could eat, maybe.

932
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:03,830
If we finish this,
it would be really good.

933
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:07,510
Dadda will be back in any second.

934
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,750
He's maybe working.

935
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:15,190
Dadda will be here, I promise.
Hurry up, Dadda.

936
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:18,110
Don't worry.

937
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:43,230
<i>Where are we going, Mama?</i>

938
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:45,990
We're going back to Partageuse, sweetheart.

939
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,510
Why are we leaving?

940
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,070
I really don't know why.
But we have to go.

941
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,310
Can I go back to the house, Mama?

942
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,870
No.

943
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:05,910
Okay, Mama.

944
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:08,670
I want to go back
to the house too, sweetheart.

945
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,750
Let's go.

946
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:47,590
Here you go. Go to your mom.

947
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:49,510
Why don't we take a walk?

948
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,510
I can't see.

949
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:58,470
You'll be fine.
Just talk to me. It's all right.

950
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:59,830
I'm here.

951
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,230
No.

952
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,750
Mrs. Sherbourne.

953
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:10,830
The child needs to be examined
and then taken to her mother.

954
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,310
Please don't do this.

955
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,310
Please have some pity.

956
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:17,750
Appreciate it if you didn't make it
any more difficult than it needs to be.

957
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,630
Please.

958
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:24,470
Garstone, take the child.

959
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:25,750
No.

960
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:29,110
No. Don't take my baby.

961
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:32,870
Please, no. No. No.

962
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,310
Take the child.

963
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:36,350
Take the child, Garstone.

964
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:38,150
Garstone, take the child!

965
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,990
Let me go! Let me go!

966
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:52,710
Mama! Mama!

967
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:00,670
<i>You're quite the war hero.</i>

968
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:03,030
<i>You must have killed</i>
<i>a lot of people in your time.</i>

969
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:08,550
I said you must have killed
a lot of people in your time.

970
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,510
If I ask you a question,

971
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:20,510
you will answer it.
Do you understand me?

972
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:24,630
When you ask me a question, I will.

973
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,870
Let's talk about the man in the boat.

974
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,590
What condition was he in
when you found him?

975
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,710
He was dead.

976
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,950
You sure about that?

977
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:39,070
I've seen enough bodies in my time.

978
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:42,430
Killed enough of his sort before,
have you?

979
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:46,710
One more would have
made no difference.

980
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,230
Was it because he was German?

981
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:51,510
He still had the accent, by all accounts.

982
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:54,150
He didn't have an accent
when I came across him.

983
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:55,830
He was dead.

984
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,230
My wife will tell you.

985
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,470
He was dead when we found him.

986
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:02,870
Ask her.

987
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:06,550
I intend to.

988
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,670
But I wouldn't be surprised

989
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:15,350
if she doesn't want to see you
for the rest of her life.

990
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:20,870
So why don't you just sit in here
and think about that?

991
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,310
Isabel, the law recognizes

992
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:35,510
that a wife can be powerless
at the hands of her husband.

993
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,150
So you won't be punished for his crimes.

994
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,550
But I need to ask you a question.

995
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:50,430
And I want you to think very
carefully before answering.

996
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:54,030
According to Tom,
Frank Roennfeldt was dead

997
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:56,790
when the boat washed up.
Was this true?

998
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:05,270
Isabel.

999
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:07,070
Is it true?

1000
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:13,190
Isabel.

1001
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:18,470
I want my real mama!

1002
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:20,670
I'm your mama.

1003
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,150
- It's all right.

1004
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,270
It's all right.

1005
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,870
It's all right.

1006
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,190
Can you take me to my mom?

1007
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,550
I am your mom, my darling.

1008
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,190
And this is your house.

1009
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:38,350
It's not!

1010
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,070
Grace, please don't cry.

1011
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:41,950
I'm not Grace. I'm Lucy.

1012
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:42,990
No, sweetheart.

1013
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:45,190
Your name is Grace and I'm your mama.

1014
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:46,670
No, you're not.

1015
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:51,190
And I want to go to my own house
and see my real mama.

1016
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:53,990
Grace, give me your hand,
this is your home.

1017
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:58,150
This is your home.
Sweetheart, sweetheart, it's all right.

1018
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:00,630
It's all right.

1019
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,910
It's all right.

1020
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:14,230
Darling,

1021
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,590
I brought you some tea.

1022
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:21,590
I'll just leave it here.

1023
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:25,190
I thought he loved us.

1024
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:35,190
I'll never forgive that man
as long as I live.

1025
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:40,390
Sweetheart.

1026
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:45,910
<i>I should've never let her</i>
<i>come out to Janus.</i>

1027
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:48,790
She's suffered enough.

1028
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,790
She can't take it anymore.

1029
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:56,310
Putting yourself in the firing line

1030
01:32:57,790 --> 01:32:59,830
is no way of dealing with it.

1031
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,350
Tom, she's a grown woman.

1032
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:05,750
They'll go easy on her.

1033
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,070
They won't touch her.

1034
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:09,910
It's your life we're talking about.

1035
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,630
They don't want to just charge you
with child-stealing.

1036
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,990
They want to get you for murder!

1037
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:19,830
I had this coming for a long time, Ralph.

1038
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:22,590
Sins catch up with you in the end.

1039
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,230
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1040
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:26,550
Wake up!

1041
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:29,750
Tom!

1042
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,350
Do me a favor.

1043
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,230
Anything.

1044
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:40,470
Get me a bit of paper and a pencil.

1045
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:47,870
From Tom.

1046
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:52,390
That man needs you.

1047
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,310
So does my little girl.

1048
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,830
Let's look at these buttons.

1049
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:47,390
Do you think this would go with
the green fabric for the riding satchel?

1050
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:48,510
Yes.

1051
01:34:57,830 --> 01:35:01,070
Make a bow, or a ribbon.

1052
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:03,510
Something like that.

1053
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:05,830
Lucy.

1054
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,190
Look at that pink thread.

1055
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:08,750
Mama!

1056
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:12,510
Lucy!

1057
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:13,990
Mama!

1058
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:15,430
My darling.

1059
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:19,350
Look at you.

1060
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:22,670
Oh, it's all right.

1061
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,230
I've missed you.

1062
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:29,390
My love.

1063
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:33,630
Time to go home.

1064
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:35,110
Mama.

1065
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,910
Make her go away.

1066
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:39,990
It's all right. Yeah.

1067
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,590
Grace, I know this is very hard
for you to understand,

1068
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:45,510
but we can't stay here.

1069
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:49,510
She's my daughter.

1070
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,950
Let go of my daughter.

1071
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:54,790
Mama.
I'm here.

1072
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:57,630
Please give me back my daughter.

1073
01:35:57,870 --> 01:35:59,350
Oh, dear.

1074
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:00,710
Please.

1075
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:03,430
I have to take her now.

1076
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:04,830
Mama. I don't like going with...

1077
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,110
I want to stay with you.

1078
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:29,470
I can stay here if you prefer.

1079
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,190
There's no need.

1080
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:54,350
I need to know.

1081
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:57,070
Was it really all your doing?

1082
01:36:58,030 --> 01:36:59,190
Yes.

1083
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:03,990
How could you do such a thing?

1084
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:10,030
You sorry for what you did?

1085
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:13,750
Sorrier than I can say.

1086
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,710
Do what you like to me.

1087
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,710
I'm not asking forgiveness.

1088
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:42,030
My wife,

1089
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:46,630
she had no choice.

1090
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:50,950
Show her some mercy.

1091
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,670
Grace, my love,

1092
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:09,310
it's dinner time.

1093
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:12,870
Are you hiding?

1094
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:15,030
Grace?

1095
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:18,870
My love?

1096
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:22,990
Are you hiding, darling?

1097
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:25,870
Grace, are you hungry?

1098
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:30,390
Why don't you come out, sweetheart?

1099
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:32,590
Come on, Mum's going to
come and get you out.

1100
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:35,310
I'm going to lift up the curtain.
And then we can

1101
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:36,910
have some dinner together,
all right, darling?

1102
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:38,910
I'm going to come get you.

1103
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:45,230
Grace?

1104
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:49,430
Grace?

1105
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:53,110
Grace, darling?

1106
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:54,950
Grace?

1107
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:57,150
Grace?

1108
01:38:58,150 --> 01:38:59,310
Darling, it's not funny.

1109
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:01,430
I want you to come out right now.

1110
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:02,670
Grace?

1111
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,270
Grace?

1112
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:06,470
Grace?

1113
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:08,230
Grace?

1114
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,190
Grace!

1115
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:12,630
Grace, darling, it's not funny.

1116
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:14,190
Please, come out!

1117
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:15,830
Grace!

1118
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:18,750
Grace!

1119
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:22,430
Grace!

1120
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,190
Grace!

1121
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:31,110
Mr. Graysmark.

1122
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:32,750
Evening, Vernon.

1123
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:34,510
Evening, Harry.

1124
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:37,710
Here about the Roennfeldt girl.

1125
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:38,870
Hannah?

1126
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:41,630
No, her daughter. Grace.

1127
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:45,790
Have you got her here?

1128
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:48,030
'Course I haven't got her.

1129
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:49,630
What on earth are you suggesting?

1130
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,430
- Is your daughter in?
- Yes.

1131
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:56,270
Sure?

1132
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:57,710
'Course I'm sure.

1133
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:58,750
What's the matter?

1134
01:39:58,830 --> 01:39:59,790
Mrs. Graysmark,

1135
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:02,030
we need to see your daughter.
If you could fetch her please.

1136
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:07,670
Isabel.

1137
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:11,710
Isabel?

1138
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:14,630
Isabel?

1139
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,910
Lucy!
Grace!

1140
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,190
Lucy!

1141
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:37,870
Grace!

1142
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:39,870
Grace!
Grace.

1143
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,070
Grace!

1144
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:42,190
Grace!

1145
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:43,830
Grace!

1146
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:45,950
Grace!
Lucy!

1147
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,190
Grace!

1148
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:53,630
Lucy!

1149
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,630
Grace!

1150
01:40:58,030 --> 01:40:59,030
Grace!

1151
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:00,350
Sergeant?

1152
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:02,310
Grace!

1153
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:03,790
Lucy!

1154
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:07,630
Sergeant!

1155
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,470
Sergeant!

1156
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:19,990
Grace!

1157
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:25,350
Lucy!

1158
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:29,470
<i>Keep her safe, Lord.</i>

1159
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:33,630
Protect her.

1160
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,510
Save her.

1161
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:40,830
You saved her once before.

1162
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:47,590
I promise you that I will
put her first from now on.

1163
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:52,390
If you'll only save her again.

1164
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:56,350
I promise you

1165
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:00,430
that I will do what's right for her.

1166
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,110
Grace!

1167
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,230
Lucy!

1168
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:06,510
Grace!

1169
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,790
Lucy!

1170
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,110
She's asleep.

1171
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,310
She said she was looking
for the lighthouse.

1172
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,270
Got nine lives, this one.

1173
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:36,110
- Oh, yeah.
- You've got her?

1174
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,350
- Thank you.
- It's okay. It's all right.

1175
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:39,990
Thank you.

1176
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:42,070
Thank you.

1177
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,870
<i>Imagine a better one.</i>

1178
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:56,910
<i>Imagine now it takes you</i>

1179
01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:00,950
<i>all the way to Sleepyland.</i>

1180
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,870
Down the road and through the path.

1181
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:08,470
And through the forest.

1182
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:13,710
I'm whispering nice things
for her dreams.

1183
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:19,350
And she's flying through.

1184
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:22,470
<i>You have been through</i>
<i>so much in your life</i>

1185
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,110
<i>and you are always happy.</i>

1186
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:29,350
<i>How do you do it?</i>

1187
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:32,710
<i>You only have to forgive once.</i>

1188
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:37,270
To resent you have to do it all day,
every day.

1189
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:38,510
All the time.

1190
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,830
You have to keep
remembering the bad things.

1191
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:45,270
It's too much work.

1192
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:48,470
You're so handsome.

1193
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,350
<i>She could have died.</i>

1194
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:27,030
Yes, but she's alive.

1195
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:30,230
It's what you do now that's important.

1196
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,710
Tom's still your husband.

1197
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,430
Lucy's young.

1198
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:42,710
She's got people to take care of her

1199
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:44,870
and give her a good life.

1200
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,150
Tom has no one.

1201
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:54,750
He'll end up in jail.

1202
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,230
Or worse.

1203
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:01,630
I don't think there's much time.

1204
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:28,310
I've come here to say something.

1205
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:29,670
Just to say it and then go.

1206
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:35,070
I know that my daughter
isn't coming back to me.

1207
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:40,070
After last night I've realized
that she can live without me.

1208
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:43,430
Even if I can't without her.

1209
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,990
I can't punish her

1210
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,510
for what happened,

1211
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:53,870
and, um, can't punish you
for your husband's decisions.

1212
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,590
Grace loves...

1213
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,470
Loves you.

1214
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:01,950
And perhaps...

1215
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:09,190
Perhaps, she belongs to you.

1216
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:15,150
So if you testify against your husband

1217
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:19,070
and, soon as he's safely locked away,

1218
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:22,190
I will let Grace come back to you.

1219
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,390
Prosecuting officer is here

1220
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,590
to take you to Albany.

1221
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:50,830
Where you'll be tried for murder.

1222
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:54,350
If there is anything more
you want to tell me,

1223
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:56,790
this is your last chance.

1224
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:03,670
No, thank you.

1225
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:45,110
It's not the best weather for the boat.

1226
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:47,390
Addicott can make it.

1227
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,430
Well, open the cell.

1228
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,910
Hurry up.

1229
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:17,070
<i>Isabel, love.</i>

1230
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:18,990
<i>I couldn't go on the way things were.</i>

1231
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:22,390
<i>I couldn't live with myself.</i>

1232
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,350
<i>I'm sorrier than</i>
<i>I'll ever be able to say for hurting you.</i>

1233
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,990
<i>We each get a little turn at life.</i>

1234
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:34,630
<i>And if this ends up being</i>
<i>how my turn went,</i>

1235
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:36,630
<i>it will still have been worth it.</i>

1236
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:40,910
<i>My time should have</i>
<i>been up years ago.</i>

1237
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:43,110
<i>To have met you,</i>

1238
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:45,630
<i>when I thought life was over.</i>

1239
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:48,350
<i>And been loved by you.</i>

1240
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:50,950
<i>If I lived another 100 years,</i>

1241
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:53,430
<i>I couldn't ask for better than that.</i>

1242
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:57,670
<i>I have loved you</i>
<i>as best as I know, Isabel.</i>

1243
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:59,950
<i>Which isn't saying much.</i>

1244
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:04,070
<i>You deserved someone</i>
<i>a lot better than me.</i>

1245
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:07,230
<i>All I can do is ask God.</i>

1246
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:11,190
<i>And ask you to forgive me</i>
<i>for the harm I've caused.</i>

1247
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:15,590
<i>And to thank you for</i>
<i>every day we spent together.</i>

1248
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:18,830
<i>I will always be your loving husband.</i>

1249
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:20,190
<i>Tom.</i>

1250
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:40,710
I need to see my husband.

1251
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:43,310
He's already gone.

1252
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:44,550
Where?

1253
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:45,750
He's on the boat.

1254
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:06,830
That one?
That one.

1255
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:23,430
- Hi, Tom.
- Ralph.

1256
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:27,230
Where's Blue?

1257
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,030
Um, couldn't make it.

1258
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:34,870
Tom!

1259
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:42,710
We need to go.

1260
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:44,710
Tom?

1261
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:49,230
Cast off now, Ralph!

1262
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:52,550
Don't, Isabel.

1263
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:54,070
I just want to say goodbye.

1264
01:50:58,510 --> 01:51:00,110
- It's all right.

1265
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,870
Shh.

1266
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:04,830
-Tom!
- Shh!

1267
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:07,830
Shh.

1268
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,150
It's all right. It's all right.

1269
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,790
- It's not true!
- Shh!

1270
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:18,710
- It's not true!
- Just leave things be.

1271
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:20,430
Isabel...

1272
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:23,270
Frank was dead when
the boat washed up. It was my idea.

1273
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:24,510
- Don't say any more.
- I stopped him from

1274
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:27,030
reporting the boat. It's my fault.

1275
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:30,710
It's my fault.

1276
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:35,030
I'm sorry.

1277
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:42,550
It's all right.

1278
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:44,670
- Tom...
- Don't say any more.

1279
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,430
She said that?

1280
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:54,990
Yes.

1281
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:57,750
She was a decent girl
before she went out on Janus.

1282
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:02,470
Being out on that island
didn't do her any good at all.

1283
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:04,950
What happens to them now?

1284
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:08,310
They go to jail.

1285
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:12,870
They go to jail.

1286
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:20,750
For how long?

1287
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:23,350
Long enough to think
about what they've done.

1288
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:26,750
Think they need jail for that?

1289
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:31,150
Mrs. Roennfeldt, people are responsible

1290
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:32,990
for their own actions.

1291
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:35,790
And when they cross certain lines,

1292
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:37,950
there needs to be consequence.

1293
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:41,390
What if I spoke for them?

1294
01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:43,390
Asked for clemency?

1295
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:44,550
Clemency?

1296
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:47,150
What would happen then?

1297
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:50,550
Some fines, a few months jail, maybe.

1298
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,430
Why would you do that?

1299
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:56,670
Because you only have to forgive once.

1300
01:52:57,870 --> 01:52:59,750
Thank you very much, Sergeant.

1301
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,550
Do you think you could
find your own way out?

1302
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:10,590
Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Roennfeldt.

1303
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,110
Good to see a smile, girlie.

1304
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:45,710
I know you've been sad.
You missed your old life.

1305
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,190
I do.

1306
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:50,630
I know what that's like
because that's what happened to me.

1307
01:53:50,710 --> 01:53:52,550
I had to say goodbye to my mum.

1308
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:53,710
Your mum?

1309
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:55,950
I had to go across
the sea in a sailing ship.

1310
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,150
And when I wasn't much older than you.

1311
01:53:58,230 --> 01:54:01,110
I came here
and I got a new mum and dad.

1312
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:03,190
They looked after me from then on.

1313
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:04,670
They loved me.

1314
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:07,550
Just like my Hannah loves you.

1315
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:10,630
You know who was a good rider
when they were little?

1316
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:12,430
My Hannah!

1317
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:15,630
She was good at everything
when she was a little one.

1318
01:54:16,110 --> 01:54:18,710
Always kept me on my toes.
Just like you.

1319
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:21,750
My saving Grace, you are.

1320
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:23,350
I'm not Grace.

1321
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:27,950
You know you were called Grace
from the day you were born.

1322
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:30,750
But I want to be called Lucy.

1323
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:33,510
Why don't I call you Lucy-Grace?

1324
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:34,710
Yeah!

1325
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,590
Yes? Have we got a deal?

1326
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:38,910
Mmm-hmm.

1327
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:44,950
Hi!

1328
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:50,190
We're back.

1329
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:51,590
Surprise!

1330
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:56,030
You tell Hannah about all the birdies

1331
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:57,150
that you saw.

1332
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:58,350
How many did you see?

1333
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:00,710
Five.

1334
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:01,830
Oh, that's good.

1335
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:06,190
You've been with Grandpa?
He's been looking after you?

1336
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:08,110
- Yeah.
- Shall I...

1337
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:10,710
Shall I show you how
to make a daisy chain?

1338
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:12,190
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1339
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,510
- Do you know how?
- No.

1340
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:16,070
I'm going to show you.

1341
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:20,790
A little hole. There's a hole.
Can you stick it through?

1342
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:24,110
Look at that! Well done, darling.

1343
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,430
Then we can join them all together.

1344
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:30,030
Look at this!

1345
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,830
Do you like a crown?

1346
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:32,870
Yeah.

1347
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,150
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

1348
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:36,990
- Would you like to wear it?
- Yeah.

1349
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:38,710
Should we put it on you?

1350
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:40,870
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1351
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:45,710
Oh, that looks so pretty.

1352
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:50,830
Oh, it's come off.
How about we put it around me?

1353
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:54,470
Make a daisy necklace? Let's try.

1354
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:56,150
How about we, Grandpa...

1355
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:58,430
How about you could
wear it on your head?

1356
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:00,670
All right. You want to put it on my head?

1357
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:01,910
And you could keep it.

1358
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:04,150
All right. Thank you, darling.

1359
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:06,550
Thank you.

1360
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,710
Do you think God will forgive me?

1361
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:30,750
He forgave you a long time ago.

1362
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:36,230
It's about time you did, too.

1363
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:14,550
Afternoon.

1364
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:16,470
You lost?

1365
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:17,910
Hope not.

1366
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:19,910
I'm searching for the
Sherbourne property.

1367
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:21,430
Tom and Isabel?

1368
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:23,150
You've found it.

1369
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:28,790
My name is Lucy-Grace Rutherford.

1370
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:32,910
I'm Lucy.

1371
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:36,630
Lucy.

1372
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:39,790
I've got something to show you.

1373
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:54,630
This is Christopher.

1374
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:00,390
She never stopped talking about you.

1375
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:02,870
She always hoped you would come.

1376
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:07,830
I couldn't come any sooner.

1377
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:13,430
I never had the chance to say thank you.
To both of you.

1378
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:16,470
For saving me.

1379
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:19,750
And taking such good care of me.

1380
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:23,310
There is nothing to thank us for.

1381
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,950
Hey.

1382
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:32,470
She left something for you.

1383
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:12,630
<i>My darling Lucy.</i>

1384
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:18,230
<i>It has been such a long time.</i>

1385
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:21,110
Hey.

1386
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:24,230
<i>I'd promised</i>

1387
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,510
<i>I 'd stay away from you</i>
<i>and I've stuck to my word.</i>

1388
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:30,710
<i>However hard that was for me.</i>

1389
01:59:31,590 --> 01:59:33,430
<i>I'm gone now.</i>

1390
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:35,910
<i>Which is why you have this letter.</i>

1391
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:38,510
<i>And it brings me joy</i>

1392
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:41,990
<i>because it means that</i>
<i>you came to find us.</i>

1393
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:47,510
<i>I never gave up hope that you would.</i>

1394
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:52,390
<i>Knowing you were safe and loved</i>

1395
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:55,910
<i>allowed us to live</i>
<i>our lives away from you.</i>

1396
01:59:58,510 --> 02:00:00,750
<i>I hope life has been kind to you.</i>

1397
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:05,510
<i>I hope that you can forgive me</i>
<i>for keeping you.</i>

1398
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:08,750
<i>And for letting you go.</i>

1399
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:16,310
<i>Know that you have</i>
<i>always been beloved.</i>

1400
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:32,870
Look at you.

1401
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:37,870
Isabel would have just
loved to have met you.

1402
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:42,710
She would have loved you.

1403
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:53,030
Could Christopher and I come back

1404
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:54,790
and visit you again?

1405
02:00:57,870 --> 02:00:59,910
I would like that very much.

1406
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:04,750
Great.
