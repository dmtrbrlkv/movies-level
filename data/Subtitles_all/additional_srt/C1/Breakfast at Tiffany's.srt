1
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,839
Hey.

2
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,641
Hey, baby. What's going on here?

3
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,851
Oh, hi.

4
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,082
Miss Golightly.

5
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,170
Some day... Some day...

6
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,881
Miss Golightly.

7
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,926
What happened to you, anyway?

8
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,679
You take off for the powder room
and that's the last I see you.

9
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,432
-Now, really, Harry...
-Harry was the other guy.

10
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,685
I'm Sid. Sid Arbuck.
You like me, remember?

11
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,439
Miss Golightly, I protest!

12
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,026
Oh, darling, I am sorry,
but I lost my key.

13
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,944
But that was two weeks ago.

14
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,780
You cannot go on
and keep ringing my bell.

15
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,034
You disturb me!
You must have a key made!

16
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,620
But it won't do any good.
I just lose them all.

17
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,039
Come on, baby. You like me.
You know you do.

18
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,373
I worship you, Mr Arbuck,

19
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,126
-but good night, Mr Arbuck.
-Baby, wait a minute. What is this?

20
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,086
You like me. I'm a liked guy.

21
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,130
You like me, baby. You know you do.

22
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,049
Didn't I pick up the check
for five people?

23
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,634
Your friends.
I've never seen them before.

24
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,969
And when you asked for a little change
for the powder room,

25
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,804
what do I give you? A $50 bill.

26
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,390
Now doesn't that give me some rights?

27
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,101
In 30 seconds I going to call the police!

28
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,064
All the time disturbance! I get no sleep!

29
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,733
I got to get my rest! I'm an artist!

30
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,819
I am going to call the vice squad on you!

31
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,656
Don't be angry, you dear little man,
I won't do it again.

32
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,823
If you promise not to be angry,

33
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,785
I might let you take those pictures
we mentioned.

34
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,536
When?

35
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,872
Sometime.

36
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,042
Anytime.

37
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,044
Good night.

38
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,632
I'm sorry to bother you, but I couldn't get
the downstairs door open.

39
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,429
I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

40
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,931
I couldn't get the downstairs door open.

41
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,646
I said, I guess they sent me
the upstairs key.

42
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,233
I couldn't get the downstairs door open.
I'm sorry to wake you.

43
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,943
That's quite all right.

44
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,989
It could happen to anyone,
quite frequently does. Good night.

45
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,449
I hate to...

46
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,454
I hate to bother you,
but if I could ask one more favour

47
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,331
could I use the phone?

48
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,084
Sure.

49
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,127
Why not?

50
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,421
Thank you.

51
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,341
Well, this is

52
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,469
a nice little place you've got here.

53
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,348
-You just moved in, too, huh?
-No. I've been here about a year.

54
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,517
The phone's over there.

55
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,144
Well, it was.

56
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,980
Oh, I remember.

57
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,442
I stuck it in the suitcase.
Kind of muffles the sound.

58
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,368
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,788
-Is he all right?
-Sure.

60
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,374
Sure. He's okay, aren't you, cat?

61
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,334
Poor old cat.

62
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,547
Poor slob. Poor slob without a name.

63
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,258
The way I look at it,
I don't have the right to give him one.

64
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,761
We don't belong to each other.
We just took up by the river one day.

65
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,429
I don't even want to own anything

66
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,516
until I find a place where
me and things go together.

67
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,145
I'm not sure where that is,
but I know what it's like.

68
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,231
It's like Tiffany's.

69
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,859
Tiffany's?
You mean the jewellery store?

70
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,193
That's right.

71
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,863
I'm crazy about Tiffany's.

72
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,198
Listen.

73
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,994
You know those days when you
get the mean reds?

74
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,788
The mean reds?
You mean like the blues?

75
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,956
No.

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,209
The blues are because you're getting fat
or maybe it's been raining too long.

77
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,211
You're just sad, that's all.

78
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,797
The mean reds are horrible.

79
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,134
Suddenly you're afraid and you
don't know what you're afraid of.

80
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,345
-Do you ever get that feeling?
-Sure.

81
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,473
Well, when I get it,
the only thing that does any good

82
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,059
is to jump into a cab and go to Tiffany's.

83
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,978
Calms me down right away.

84
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,814
The quietness and the proud look of it.

85
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,400
Nothing very bad
could happen to you there.

86
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,485
If I could find a real-life place

87
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,238
that made me feel like Tiffany's, then...

88
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,409
Then I'd buy some furniture
and give the cat a name.

89
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,705
I'm sorry. You wanted something.

90
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,749
Oh! The telephone.

91
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,501
It's just that I was supposed
to meet somebody.

92
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,713
I mean, this is
10:00 Thursday morning, isn't it?

93
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,674
I just got off a plane from Rome
and I'm not too sure.

94
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,594
Thursday. Is this Thursday?

95
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,263
-I think so.
-Thursday! Oh, no, it can't be!

96
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,932
It's too gruesome.

97
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,188
Well, what's so gruesome
about Thursday?

98
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,274
Nothing, except I can never remember
when it's coming up.

99
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,276
Wednesdays,
I generally just don't go to bed at all

100
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,779
because I have to be up to catch
the 10:45.

101
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,615
And they're so particular
about visiting hours.

102
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,617
Would you be a darling
and look under the bed

103
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,953
and see if you can find
a pair of alligator shoes?

104
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,120
Sure.

105
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,708
I've got to do something
about the way I look.

106
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,962
I mean, a girl just can't go to Sing Sing
with a green face.

107
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,421
-Sing Sing?

108
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,967
Yes, I always thought it was
a ridiculous name for a prison.

109
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,054
Sing Sing, I mean. It sounds more like it
should be an opera house or something.

110
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,764
Black alligator.

111
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,893
You know, all the visitors make an effort
to look their best. It's only fair.

112
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,980
Actually, it's very touching, all the
women wearing their prettiest things.

113
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,565
I just love them for it.
And I love the kids, too.

114
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,484
I mean the kids the wives bring.

115
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,987
It should be sad seeing kids there,
but it isn't.

116
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,240
They all have ribbons in their hair
and lots of shine on their shoes.

117
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,992
You'd think there was going to be
ice cream.

118
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,744
Now, as I understand it,
what we're doing is getting you ready

119
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,247
-to visit somebody at Sing Sing.
-That's right.

120
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,083
You can always tell what kind of person
a man really thinks you are

121
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,002
by the earrings he gives you.

122
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,170
I must say, the mind reels.

123
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,672
May I ask whom?

124
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,258
Whom what?
Oh, whom I go to visit, you mean?

125
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,926
I guess that's what I mean.

126
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,012
I don't know
that I should even discuss it.

127
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,347
Well, they never told me
not to tell anyone.

128
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,850
You must cross your heart
and kiss your elbow.

129
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,143
I'll try.

130
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,688
You probably read about him.
His name's Sally Tomato.

131
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,106
Sally Tomato?

132
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,441
Well, don't look so shocked.

133
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,775
They could never prove for a second

134
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,278
that he was even part of the Mafia,
much less head of it, my dear.

135
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,197
The only thing they did prove was
that he cheated his income tax a little.

136
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,867
Anyway, all I know
is that he's a darling old man.

137
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,202
Oh, he was never my lover
or anything like that.

138
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,455
In fact, I never knew him
until after he was in prison.

139
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,706
But I adore him now.

140
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,625
I mean, I've been going to see him
every Thursday for seven months.

141
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,045
Now I think I'd go
even if he didn't pay me.

142
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,130
-Shoes.
-I could only find one.

143
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,719
He pays you?

144
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,971
That's right. Or anyway his lawyer does.

145
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,724
If he is a lawyer, which I doubt, since
he doesn't seem to have an office,

146
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,225
only an answering service.

147
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,187
And he always wants to meet you
at Hamburger Heaven.

148
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,983
There you are, you sneak. Thank you.

149
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,151
You're welcome.

150
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,195
Dress. Dress.

151
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,573
Here we are. Bag and a hat, too.

152
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,992
There we are.

153
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,746
Anyway, about seven months ago, this
so-called lawyer, Mr O'Shaughnessy,

154
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,915
asked me how I'd like to cheer up
a lonely old man

155
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,417
and pick up $100 a week
at the same time.

156
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,088
I told him, "Look, darling,
you've got the wrong Holly Golightly."

157
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,840
A girl can do as well as that
on trips to the powder room.

158
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,759
I mean, any gentleman
with the slightest chic

159
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,011
will give a girl a $50 bill
for the powder room.

160
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,764
And I always ask for cab fare, too.
That's another $50.

161
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,225
But then he said his client was
Sally Tomato.

162
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,228
He said dear old Sally had seen me
at Elmo's or somewhere

163
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,438
and had admired me à la distance.

164
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,274
So wouldn't it be a good deed
if I were to visit him once a week?

165
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,444
Well, how could I say no?
It was all so wildly romantic.

166
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,864
How do I look?

167
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,035
Very good. I must say I'm amazed.

168
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,580
You were a darling to help,
I could never have done it without you.

169
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,125
-Bag.
-Call me anytime.

170
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,213
I'm just upstairs, or I will be
as soon as I get moved in.

171
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,381
Bye, cat.

172
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,641
You mean he gives you $100
for an hour's conversation?

173
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,810
Well, Mr O'Shaughnessy does
as soon as I meet him

174
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,937
and give him the weather report.

175
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,189
Look, it's none of my business,
but it sounds to me

176
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,024
like you could get in a lot of trouble.

177
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,860
Hold this for me, will you?

178
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,823
And what do you mean,
"weather report"?

179
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,701
Oh, that's just a message I give
Mr O'Shaughnessy.

180
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,162
So he'll know I've really been up there.

181
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,497
Sally tells me things to say like

182
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,791
"There's a hurricane in Cuba"

183
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,836
and, "It's cloudy over Palermo."
Things like that.

184
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,381
You don't have to worry.
I've taken care of myself for a long time.

185
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,724
Taxi!

186
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,901
-I never could do that.
-It's easy.

187
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,410
Paul.

188
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,788
I'm late. I know it.

189
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,085
Don't tell me you were locked out?
Didn't you get the key?

190
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,088
Oh, darling. I'm so sorry.

191
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,842
No, I got the key, all right.

192
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,179
Miss Golightly, my neighbour,
was kind enough to let me in.

193
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,848
Miss Golightly's on her way
to Sing Sing.

194
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,017
-Oh?
-Just visiting, of course.

195
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,854
Miss Golightly,
Mrs Falenson, my decorator.

196
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,774
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

197
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:23,278
Ooh, darling. Let me look at you.

198
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,864
-Are you through?
-Was the flight absolutely ghastly?

199
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,574
I'm in a terrible rush.

200
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,953
Grand Central Station,
and step on it, darling.

201
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,916
Is it really only three weeks
since I left you in Rome?

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,584
Seems like years.

203
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,878
-You seen the apartment?
-Not yet.

204
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,507
I know it was wicked
of me, but I couldn't resist.

205
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,634
I went ahead and fixed it up without you.

206
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,135
I think it's darling, of course,

207
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,473
but if you absolutely hate it, we can rip
everything up and start from scratch.

208
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,987
Miss Golightly!

209
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,241
МАN: Hey, baby! Where you going?

210
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,538
Come on, baby. Open the door.

211
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,208
-Aw, be a pal.

212
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,961
You're breaking up a beautiful party.

213
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,632
Come on, baby. Open the door.

214
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,051
Hey, the band's swinging.

215
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,388
Come on, baby.

216
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,227
Miss Golightly.
Once again, I must protest!

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,480
If you don't stop that phonograph
right this minute,

218
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm going to call the police department!

219
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,696
Yeah. That's more better.

220
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,201
МАN: What's the matter, baby?

221
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,627
Oh, come on. You're a great kid.
Open the door.

222
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,132
Come on, baby. I'm waiting for you.

223
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,487
-It's all right. It's only me.
-Now, wait a minute. Miss...

224
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,698
Golightly. Holly Golightly.

225
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,076
I live downstairs.
We met this morning, remember?

226
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,244
Yeah.

227
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,872
It's all right. She's gone.

228
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,751
I must say,
she works late hours for a decorator.

229
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,587
The thing is, I have
the most terrifying man downstairs.

230
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,631
I mean,
he's sweet when he isn't drunk

231
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,093
but let him start lapping up the vino,
and oh, golly, quel beast.

232
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,762
It finally got so tiresome down there,
I just went out the window.

233
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,770
Look, you can throw me out
if you want to,

234
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,023
but you did look so cosy in here, and
your decorator friend had gone home

235
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,777
and it was beginning to get a bit cold
out there on the fire escape.

236
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,822
And I always heard
people in New York

237
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,032
never get to know their neighbours.

238
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,579
Well, how was Sing Sing?

239
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,205
Fine.

240
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,584
I made the train and everything.

241
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,794
And what's the weather report?

242
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,548
"Small-craft warnings
Block Island to Hatteras."

243
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,133
Whatever that means.

244
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,055
You know, you're sweet. You really are.

245
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,935
And you look
a little like my brother Fred.

246
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,396
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

247
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,856
Not at all.

248
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,404
$300, she's very generous.

249
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,241
Is it by the week, the hour or what?

250
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,076
Okay, the party's over. Out.

251
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,121
Oh, Fred. Darling Fred, I'm sorry.

252
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,750
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Don't be angry.

253
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,003
I was just trying to let you know
I understand.

254
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,963
I understand completely.

255
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,258
It's okay, stick around.
Make yourself a drink.

256
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,676
Throw me my robe
and I'll make you one.

257
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,053
You stay right where you are.

258
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,388
You must be absolutely exhausted.

259
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,808
I mean, it is very late

260
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,310
and you were sound asleep
and everything.

261
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,023
I suppose you think I'm very brazen
or très fou or something.

262
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,150
I don't think you're any fouer
than anybody else.

263
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,986
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
And I don't mind.

264
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,448
It's useful being top banana
in the shock department.

265
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,453
What do you do, anyway?

266
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,290
-I'm a writer, I guess.
-You guess? Don't you know?

267
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,294
Okay. Positive statement.
Ringing affirmative.

268
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,588
I'm a writer.

269
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,176
The only writer I've ever been out with
is Benny Shacklett.

270
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,638
He's written an awful lot
of television stuff, but quel rat.

271
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,267
Tell me, are you a real writer?

272
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,479
I mean, does anybody buy
what you write or publish it or anything?

273
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,732
They bought what's in that box.

274
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,902
-Yours?
-Mmm-hmm.

275
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,029
All these books?

276
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,906
Well, there's just the one book.

277
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,408
Twelve copies of it.

278
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,702
"Nine Lives by Paul Varjak."

279
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,288
They're stories.

280
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,415
Mmm-hmm. Nine of them.

281
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,085
-Tell me one.

282
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,297
They're not the kind of stories
you can really tell.

283
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,590
Too dirty?

284
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,012
Yeah, I suppose they're dirty, too,
but only incidentally.

285
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,183
Mainly they're angry, sensitive,
intensely felt

286
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,478
and that dirtiest of all dirty words,
promising.

287
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:35,275
Or so said The Times Book Review,
October 1st, 1956.

288
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,278
-1956?
-That's right.

289
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,783
I suppose this is kind of a ratty question,
but what have you written lately?

290
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,870
Lately I've been working on a novel.

291
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,290
-Lately, since 1956?
-Well, a novel takes a long time.

292
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,085
-I want to get it exactly right.
-So no more stories.

293
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,795
Well, the idea is

294
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,174
I'm supposed to not fritter
my talent away on little things.

295
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,801
I'm supposed to be saving it
for the big one.

296
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,846
Tell me, do you write every day?

297
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,014
Sure.

298
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,475
-Today?
-Sure.

299
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,728
-It's a beautiful typewriter.
-Of course.

300
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,148
It writes nothing but sensitive,
intensely felt, promising prose.

301
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,150
But there's no ribbon in it.

302
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,819
-There isn't?
-No.

303
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,530
Oh.

304
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,577
You know, something you said
this morning has been

305
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,287
bothering me all day.

306
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,664
What's that?

307
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,501
Do they really give you $50
whenever you go to the powder room?

308
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,835
Of course.

309
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,672
You must do very well.

310
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,008
I'm trying to save,
but I'm not very good at it.

311
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,892
You know,
you do look a lot like my brother Fred.

312
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,605
I haven't seen him, of course,
since I was 14. That's when I left home.

313
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,941
And he was already 6'2".

314
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,404
I guess it must have been
the peanut butter that did it.

315
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,700
Everybody thought he was dotty the way
he gorged himself on peanut butter.

316
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,452
But he wasn't dotty.

317
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,873
Just sweet and vague and terribly slow.

318
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,713
Poor Fred. He's in the army now.

319
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,050
It's really the best place for him
until I can get enough money saved.

320
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,137
-And then?
-And then Fred and I...

321
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,890
I went to Mexico once.

322
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,269
It's a wonderful place for raising horses.

323
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,772
I saw one place near the sea that...

324
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,942
Fred's very good with horses.

325
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,571
But even land in Mexico
costs something.

326
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,073
And no matter what I do,
there never seems to be more than

327
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,616
a couple of hundred dollars in the bank.

328
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,246
It can't be 4:30.

329
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,082
It just can't.

330
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,591
Do you mind if I just get in with you
for a minute?

331
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,595
It's all right. Really, it is.

332
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,973
We're friends, that's all.

333
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,687
We are friends, aren't we?

334
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,106
Sure.

335
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,032
Okay.

336
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,285
Let's don't say another word.

337
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,455
Let's just go to sleep.

338
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,646
Where are you, Fred?

339
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,817
Because it's cold.

340
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,949
There's snow and wind.

341
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,579
-What is it? What's the matter?

342
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,792
Why are you crying?

343
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,510
If we're going to be friends, let's just
get one thing straight right now.

344
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,138
I hate snoops.

345
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,192
-Yeah.
-Lucille, darling? 2-E.

346
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,318
Huh?

347
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,571
I've been trying desperately
to reach you.

348
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,072
Bill just got back.

349
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,866
A day early, the beast.

350
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,243
So I'm afraid I'll have to beg off.

351
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,787
You'll explain to the rest of the girls?

352
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,582
You're a darling.

353
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,418
Maybe we can have
a long lunch tomorrow.

354
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,254
-I'll phone you in the morning.
-Mmm-hmm.

355
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,423
Whatever you say.

356
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,718
And you will manage to survive
without me tonight?

357
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,928
Sure.

358
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,598
I might even take
a wild, boyish fling at writing.

359
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,935
-Good night.
-Good night.

360
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,879
You got yourself stuffed, huh,
Polly, baby?

361
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,465
Serves you right,
big mouth.

362
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,806
-Buongiorno.
-Huh?

363
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,350
Aren't you drinking?

364
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,060
Mmm-hmm.

365
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,022
You got pockets there or something?
What do you go by?

366
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,148
Hmm?

367
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,277
What's your name? What's your name?
What do you call yourself?

368
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,905
-Irving.
-Perfect. Perfect.

369
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,740
That's wonderful, Irving.

370
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,828
-I'll be right back, Irving, baby.
-Mmm-hmm.

371
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,212
Yeah? Whoa! Kid's still in the shower.
You expected?

372
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,089
I was invited. That what you mean?

373
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,092
Now don't get yourself
all tense and sore, pal. Come on in.

374
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,929
It's a party. There's a lot of characters
come around here, they're not expected.

375
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,180
I'll buy you a drink. You drink?

376
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,348
-Yeah.
-Then I'll buy you a drink.

377
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,516
Okay.

378
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,186
Hey, honey, your skirt's split there.

379
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,147
-What do you drink, kid?
-Bourbon.

380
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,315
-Bourbon?
-Mmm-hmm.

381
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,608
-On the rocks?
-Yeah. No. With water.

382
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,444
All right, you want rocks first, though,
don't you?

383
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,862
-Yeah.
-Good, you got them.

384
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,698
-Not too much.
-All right. That'll set you free.

385
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,826
-You know the kid long?
-Not very. I live upstairs.

386
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,120
You're kidding.
Boy, look at this place, will you?

387
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,914
What a place. It's unbelievable.
What a dump.

388
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,333
What do you think?

389
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,169
-About what?
-Is she or isn't she?

390
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,671
-Wait a minute. Hold it.

391
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,217
-Harriet.
-Hi, J.B.

392
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,802
"J.B."? O.J. What is that?

393
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,137
All right. Hello there.

394
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,056
-You know Gil.
-Yeah. How are you? Good to see you.

395
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,599
-How about a drink?
-Fine. In the kitchen.

396
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,185
-You'll find everything you need.
-Thanks.

397
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,647
So... Oh, honey, that is you, that is you.

398
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,233
Fred, darling,
I'm so glad you could come.

399
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,986
I brought you a house present,
something for the bookcase.

400
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,738
You're sweet.

401
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,159
Doesn't that look nice?
Give me a cigarette, O.J.

402
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,327
Sure, sure.

403
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,913
O.J.'s a great agent. He knows
a terrific lot of phone numbers.

404
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,664
What's Jerry Wald's
phone number, O.J.?

405
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:29,832
Oh, come on, lay off.

406
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,585
Darling, I want you to call him
and tell him what a genius Fred is.

407
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,753
Yeah, I got it.

408
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,256
Stop blushing, Fred.
You didn't say you were genius, I did.

409
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,343
So quit stalling, O.J.
Just tell me what you're going to do

410
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,761
to make Fred rich and famous.

411
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,014
Now why don't you let Fred baby
and me settle that matter, huh, puppy?

412
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,266
Okay. But just remember, I'm the agent.

413
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,852
He's already got a decorator,
I'm the agent.

414
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,397
-Hold it. Hold it.

415
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,108
Hi, there, boys. Come on in, there.

416
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,194
Right in the kitchen,
you'll find everything you need.

417
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,906
So, listen, Fred baby.

418
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,118
-No, it's Paul baby.
-Oh, it is? I thought it was Fred baby.

419
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,285
-No.
-Well, answer the question, all right?

420
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,205
-Is she or isn't she?
-Is she or isn't she what?

421
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,790
A phoney.

422
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,126
I don't know. I don't think so.

423
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,796
You don't think so, huh?
Well, you're wrong, she is.

424
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,967
But on the other hand, you're right,
because she's a real phoney.

425
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,636
You know why? Because she
honestly believes all this phoney junk

426
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
that she believes in.

427
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:28,224
I mean it. Now look, I like the kid.
I mean, I sincerely like the kid. I do.

428
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,809
I mean, I'm sensitive, that's why.

429
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,145
I mean, you gotta be sensitive
to like the kid, you know what I mean?

430
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,896
It's what you call a touch,
a streak of the poet,

431
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,981
you know what I mean?

432
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,232
You known her long?

433
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,733
Are you kidding?
I'm the guy that discovered her.

434
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:38,985
I'm O.J. Berman.

435
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,570
A couple of years ago,
back on the coast there.

436
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,156
She was just a kid. Of course,
she had a lot of style. A lot of class.

437
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,491
-A lot of what?
-Class. I said she had lot of class.

438
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,243
But of course,
when she opened her mouth,

439
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,996
you didn't know what she was talking,
whether she was a hillbilly or an Okie.

440
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,998
You know how long it took me
to smooth out that accent?

441
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,332
-No.
-I'll tell you how long.

442
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,626
-One year. You know how we did it?
-Mmm-mmm.

443
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,336
We gave her French lessons. Yeah.

444
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,838
Figured once she could
imitate French,

445
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,840
she'd have no trouble imitating English.

446
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,010
And, finally, when I thought she'd be
ready, I arranged for a little screen test.

447
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,929
Well, the night before the screen test...
Well, I could've killed myself.

448
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,514
The night before the screen test,
the phone rings.

449
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,683
I pick it up, I said, "O.J. speaking."
She says, "This is Holly."

450
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,019
I says, "Holly? Holly, you sound
so far away, honey. What's with you?"

451
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,187
She says, "I'm in New York."

452
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,605
I said, "What?
You got a screen test tomorrow."

453
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,024
She says, "I'm in New York because
I've never been to New York before."

454
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,358
I said, "Get yourself on the plane.
Get back here."

455
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,526
She says, "I don't wanna."

456
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,612
I say, "What do you mean,
you don't wanna? What do you want?"

457
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,697
She says, "I don't wanna."
I say, "What do you want?"

458
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,617
She says, "When I find out what I want,
I'm gonna let you know." Bang.

459
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,536
-So, look, Fred baby, you know...
-It's Paul baby.

460
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,955
Paul baby. Sure. I mean,
don't tell me that she isn't a phoney.

461
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,123
You know what I mean?

462
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,126
Irving. Honey, Irving,
where have you been?

463
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,311
Great, thanks.

464
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,189
Mike, darling,
I tried reaching you all day long.

465
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,483
Your answering service doesn't answer.

466
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,276
You know the trouble people have
with answering services.

467
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,029
Well, I guess so.
Careful your mother never...

468
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,573
-MIKE: She's been running around.

469
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,242
You look so wonderful.

470
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,662
I know. And after all that she said
about him, and he knows that.

471
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,123
Holly.

472
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,466
-Do you have the time, darling?
-What?

473
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,717
The time?

474
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,427
-Do you have a watch?
-No, I don't.

475
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,973
-Let me see it. It's 6:45.
-Thank you so much, dear.

476
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,976
Can I borrow it?

477
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,152
Really, was that necessary?

478
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,672
This is some party.
Who are all these people, anyhow?

479
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,924
Who knows? The word gets out.

480
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,468
You don't mind, do you, darling?

481
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,221
Mmm! Reinforcements.

482
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,352
-Where do I put it?
-Right in there.

483
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,284
Holly.

484
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,080
Holly, darling.

485
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,459
-What's that?
-Mag Wildwood.

486
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,585
Oh?

487
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,921
She's a model, believe it or not,
and a thumping bore.

488
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,467
But just look at the goodies
she brought with her.

489
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,222
He's all right, I suppose, if you like
dark, handsome, rich-looking men

490
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,391
with passionate natures
and too many teeth.

491
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,977
I don't mean that one.
I mean the other one.

492
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,691
-The other one?
-He's Rusty Trawler.

493
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,069
-Hmm?
-Rusty Trawler.

494
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,864
He happens to be the ninth-richest man
in America under 50.

495
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,745
Now that indeed is a remarkable piece
of information to have at your fingertips.

496
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,747
I keep track of these things.

497
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,126
-Excuse me. You owe me $47...
-Hold this a minute, will you, darling?

498
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,798
Mag, darling, what are you doing here?

499
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,635
Honey, I was upstairs
working with Yunioshi.

500
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,012
Easter stuff for the Bazaar.

501
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:38,307
Then these two nice boys came
to pick me up.

502
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:42,061
It was a mistake, of course.
My wires got crossed somewhere.

503
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,563
They were both very sweet about it.

504
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:48,109
May I present José da Silva Pereira?

505
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,444
He's from Brazil.

506
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,363
Miss Golightly.

507
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,660
Very kind of you, Miss Golightly,
to allow me to attend your party.

508
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,496
I'm so interested
in North American culture.

509
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,582
I've been already, of course,
to the Statue of Liberty

510
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,127
and to the restaurant Automatique.

511
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:10,464
But this is the first time
I'm in a typical North American home.

512
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,093
Wouldn't he just melt in your mouth?

513
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,928
And this is Mr Rusty Trawler.

514
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,555
-Miss Golightly.

515
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,932
You're not vexed at me
for bringing them?

516
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,143
-Of course not, darling.
-I'm glad.

517
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,229
Now, who's going to bring me
a bourbon?

518
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,106
-O.J.
-Yeah?

519
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,026
-Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?
-Yeah. Which one's Miss Wildwood?

520
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:35,239
Mr Berman, we haven't been
formally introduced,

521
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,659
but I'm Mag Wildwood
from Wildwood, Arkansas.

522
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,453
That's hill country.

523
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,371
You just make yourself
right at home, senhor.

524
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,789
Oh, do not trouble yourself.

525
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:47,877
I'm contented to stand observing
the customs of your country.

526
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,336
Okay, you do that.

527
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,547
Now, come along, Mr Trawler.

528
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,383
Let's see what we can find
to amuse you with.

529
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,275
Oh, no.

530
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,028
No, no, no.

531
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,085
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

532
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,504
You said you would pick me up,
and at the last minute, I had Gil come...

533
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,757
Look, I wasn't supposed to pick you up,
here or anywhere.

534
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,930
-Yes?
-Miss Golightly?

535
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,558
This time I'm warning you.

536
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,562
I am definitely this time going to
calling the police!

537
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,955
Good evening.

538
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,125
Is it something important?

539
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,127
No. Just the guy upstairs.

540
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,628
Complaining about the noise.

541
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,963
He's angry.

542
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,091
Well, he did mention something
about calling the police.

543
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,677
Oh, the police. The police?

544
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,431
Oh. That I cannot have. I'd better
look for Miss Wildwood and go.

545
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,186
To think I'd find a beau of mine,

546
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,315
mousing after a piece of
cheap Hollywood trash.

547
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,109
-Mag, darling, you're being a bore.
-Shut up.

548
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,697
You. You know what's going to
happen to you?

549
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:27,119
I am going to march you over to the zoo
and feed you to the yak.

550
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,122
Just as soon as I finish this drink.

551
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,467
Timber!

552
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,809
Sorry.

553
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,271
Good evening, Ed.

554
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,564
-It's Paul baby.
-Oh, yes.

555
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,232
-You remember Irving, don't you?
-Yeah. Hi, Irving.

556
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,651
-This is José.
-Nice to meet you, José.

557
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,404
-Wonderful seeing you.
-Yes.

558
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,281
Jewel thieves.

559
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,685
Sally helps me with my accounts.

560
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,979
I have no head for figures at all.

561
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,858
I'm trying desperately to save
some money. You know, I told you.

562
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,651
I just can't seem to.

563
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,279
He makes me write down
everything in there.

564
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,323
What I get, what I spend.

565
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,869
I used to have a checking account,
but he made me get rid of that.

566
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:19,124
He feels, for me, anyway, that it's better
to operate on a cash basis, tax-wise.

567
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,505
Some day, Mr Fred, you take this book,
turn it into a novel.

568
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,300
Everything is there.
Just fill in a little of the details.

569
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,636
Certainly would be good
for some laughs.

570
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,971
No. No, I don't think so.

571
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,808
This is a book would break the heart.

572
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,978
"Mr Fitzsimmons, powder room, $50."

573
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,231
"Less $18."

574
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,234
"Repair one black satin dress."

575
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,444
"Cat food, 27 cents."

576
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:51,156
Sally, darling, please stop.
You're making me blush.

577
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,952
But you're right about
Jack Fitzsimmons, he's an absolute rat.

578
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,039
I guess, of course,
I don't really know anybody but rats.

579
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,291
Except, of course, Fred here.

580
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,461
You do think Fred is nice,
don't you, Sally?

581
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,631
For you, I hope he is.

582
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,973
МАN: Give me a kiss goodbye.

583
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,644
Goodbye, Uncle Sally. Till next week.

584
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,397
Goodbye, Uncle Sally.

585
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,440
Goodbye and don't forget
to send that book, eh?

586
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,733
I won't.

587
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,405
Oh! What about the weather report?

588
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,739
Oh, yes.

589
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,368
Snow flurries expected this weekend
in New Orleans.

590
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,042
Snow flurries expected this weekend
in New Orleans?

591
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,670
Isn't that just the weirdest?

592
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,215
I bet they haven't had snow
in New Orleans for a million years.

593
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,926
I don't know how he thinks them up.

594
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,232
Moon River

595
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,446
Wider than a mile

596
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:17,242
I’m crossing you in style

597
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,204
Some day

598
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,084
Oh, dream maker

599
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:31,048
You heartbreaker

600
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,552
Wherever you're going

601
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,556
I’m going your way

602
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:45,312
Two drifters

603
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,441
Off to see the world

604
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:54,196
There's such a lot of world

605
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,657
To see

606
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,787
We're after

607
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,582
The same

608
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,754
Rainbow's end

609
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,342
Waiting 'round the bend

610
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:21,807
My huckleberry friend

611
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,352
Moon River

612
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,816
And me

613
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,952
-Hi.
-Hi.

614
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,663
-What you doing?
-Writing.

615
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,998
Good.

616
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,842
Well, hello.

617
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,013
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

618
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,515
It's probably nothing.

619
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,352
I want to see if he's still there.

620
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,480
See if who's still there?
What are you talking about?

621
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,027
Look.

622
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,996
See? I noticed him yesterday afternoon.

623
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:30,042
I didn't say anything,
I didn't want to sound neurotic

624
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,837
-but when he's there again today...
-Who do you think he is?

625
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,632
It could be anybody, of course,
but what crossed my mind was

626
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,636
suppose Bill’s having us watched, huh?

627
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,558
Okay, I'll take care of this.

628
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,895
No. No, don't. Please.

629
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,648
Look, if that's what it is,
you'll only make everything worse.

630
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,901
I'll be careful. You wait here.

631
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,653
Darling, please don't.
I don't think you should.

632
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,072
Now take it easy.

633
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,033
I just want to find out
what this is all about.

634
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,265
All right, what do you want?

635
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,977
Son, I need a friend.

636
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,825
That's me. That's her.

637
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,286
That's her brother Fred.

638
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,713
You're Holly's father?

639
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,841
Her name ain't Holly.

640
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,385
She was Lula Mae Barnes.

641
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,513
Was till she married me.

642
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,848
I'm her husband, Doc Golightly.

643
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,810
Paul Varjak.

644
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,397
I'm a horse doctor. Animal man.

645
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,567
Do some farming, too,
near Tulip, Texas.

646
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,571
Her brother Fred's
getting out of the army soon.

647
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,323
Lula Mae belongs home
with her husband,

648
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,242
her brother and her children.

649
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,493
Children?

650
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,663
Them's her children.

651
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,706
She's got four children?

652
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,252
Now, son, I didn't claim they was
her natural-born children.

653
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,171
Their own precious mother,
precious woman

654
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,841
passed away July the 4th,
Independence Day, 1955,

655
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,510
the year of the drought.

656
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,388
When I married Lula Mae,
she was going on 14.

657
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,349
Now, you might think
the average person going on 14

658
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,226
wouldn't know his own mind.

659
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,311
But you take Lula Mae.

660
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,022
She was an exceptional person.

661
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
I'll tell you, son,

662
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,448
she just plumb broke our hearts
when she run off like she done.

663
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,367
Just plain had no reason.

664
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,787
All the housework was done
by her daughters.

665
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,081
Lula Mae could just take it easy.

666
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,126
I tell you, that woman got positively fat

667
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,421
while her brother,
he growed up into a giant.

668
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,258
Which is a sight different
from the way they come to us.

669
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,927
A couple of wild young'uns, they was.

670
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,723
I caught them outside the house
stealing milk and turkey eggs.

671
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,891
Lula Mae and her brother
had been living

672
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:00,061
with some mean, no-account people
about 100 mile east of Tulip.

673
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:03,231
She had good cause to run off
from that house.

674
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,317
Never had none to leave mine.

675
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:10,238
What about her brother?
Didn't he leave, too?

676
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,991
No, sir. We had Fred with us
till they took him in the army.

677
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,869
That's what I come to talk to her about.
I had a letter from him.

678
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,746
He's getting out of the army in February.

679
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,540
That's why I got on a Greyhound bus
to come to get her.

680
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:24,336
Lula Mae's place is with her husband,
her children, and her brother.

681
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,255
Huh?

682
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,050
It's the prize in the Cracker Jack.
You want it?

683
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,301
Uh-uh.

684
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,971
Never could understand
why that woman run off.

685
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,600
Don't tell me she weren't happy.

686
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,186
Talky as a jaybird she was.

687
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,563
With something smart to say
on every subject.

688
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,440
Better than the radio.

689
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,401
The night I proposed, I cried like a baby.

690
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,696
She said, "What you want to cry for,
Doc? Of course we'll be married.

691
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,907
"I've never been married before."

692
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,869
Well, I had to laugh and to hug
and to squeeze her.

693
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,497
"Never been married before."

694
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,712
Listen, son.
I advised you I need a friend.

695
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,883
'Cause I don't want to surprise
or scare her none.

696
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,552
Be my friend. Let her know I'm here.

697
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,814
Will you do that for me, son?

698
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,238
Yeah, sure, Doc. If that's what you want.

699
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,699
Come on.

700
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,670
All right.

701
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,755
Coming.

702
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,803
Oh, darling, I'm just on my way out.

703
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,097
I was supposed to be at 21
half an hour ago.

704
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,474
Maybe we can have a drink
or something tomorrow, huh?

705
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,184
Sure, Lula Mae,

706
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,687
if you're still here tomorrow.

707
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,943
Oh, please, where is he?

708
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,824
Fred?

709
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,952
Gosh.

710
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:22,871
Lula Mae.

711
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:32,797
Gee, honey, don't they feed you
up here? You're so skinny.

712
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:41,556
-Hi, Doc.
-Gosh, Lula Mae.

713
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,350
Kingdom come.

714
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,496
What is it? What's the matter?
Are you all right?

715
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,082
I guess so. No, I'm not.

716
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,709
-Fred, will you help me?
-If I can.

717
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,045
I want you to come to the bus station
with us, Doc and me.

718
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,297
-What?
-He still thinks I'm going back with him.

719
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,758
I need support.
I don't think I can play this scene alone.

720
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,510
Holly, what can I do?
He's your husband.

721
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,346
-No, he's not.
-He's not?

722
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,808
It was annulled ages ago,
but he just won't accept it.

723
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,936
Please, Fred. I'll tell him
you're coming to see us off.

724
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,729
Don't say anything.

725
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:16,192
Just meet us out front in about an hour.
Please?

726
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,493
You wait right here, honey.
I'll get the bag.

727
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,082
Why don't I get some magazines?

728
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,376
Please, Fred. Don't leave me.

729
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,044
МАN ON PA: Attention, please.

730
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,089
Leaving from platform five,
through coach to Dallas,

731
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,800
Philadelphia, Columbus, Indianapolis,
Terre Haute,

732
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,220
St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City,
Denison, Dallas.

733
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,180
Come on, Lula Mae. That's us.

734
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,391
Doc, I'm not coming with you.

735
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:52,437
Come on. Let's walk together quietly
and I'll try and help you understand.

736
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,314
Help me talk to him, Fred.

737
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,440
It's all right, son.

738
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,902
I appreciate you wanna help,
but it's between Lula Mae and me.

739
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,320
Sure, Doc.

740
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,491
I love you, Lula Mae.

741
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,411
I know you do,
and that's just the trouble.

742
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,998
It's a mistake you always made, Doc,
trying to love a wild thing.

743
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,751
You were always lugging home
wild things.

744
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,337
Once it was
a hawk with a broken wing

745
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,715
and another time it was
a full-grown wildcat with a broken leg.

746
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,966
Remember?

747
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:23,217
Lula Mae, there's something...

748
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,678
You mustn't give your heart
to a wild thing.

749
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,722
The more you do, the stronger they get.

750
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,225
Until they're strong enough to run
into the woods or fly into a tree.

751
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,937
And then to a higher tree
and then to the sky.

752
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,689
Lula Mae, there's something
I got to tell you.

753
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,609
A couple of weeks ago,
I got a letter from young Fred.

754
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,695
From Fred? He's all right, isn't he?

755
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,698
Yeah, he's fine, I guess.

756
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,408
He's getting out of the army in February.

757
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,453
-That's what he wrote to tell me.
-In February?

758
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,705
Well, that's only four months.

759
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,916
So you see, you got to
come back with me, Lula Mae.

760
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,251
Your place is with me and your children
and your brother.

761
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,754
Doc, you've got to understand.
I can't come back.

762
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,256
And you got to understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

763
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,218
Now, I don't want to seem like I'm
pressuring you none, but now I got to.

764
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,636
If you don't come back with me,

765
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,721
I'm gonna have to write young Fred
and tell him that

766
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,474
unless he wants to look out for hisself,
he better sign up for another hitch.

767
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,102
Doc, don't you do that.
Don't write that to him.

768
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,729
I'll write him myself and tell him
I want him here with me.

769
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,356
I'll take care of him. Don't you worry.

770
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,941
You're talking crazy, Lula Mae.

771
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,361
Doc, stop calling me that.
I'm not Lula Mae any more.

772
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,036
All right, Lula Mae.

773
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,456
I guess you know what you're doing.

774
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,926
Keep an eye on her, will you, son?

775
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,346
At least see she eats something
once in a while.

776
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,931
Sure, Doc.

777
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,519
So skinny.

778
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,665
Please, Doc. Please understand.

779
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,586
I love you,
but I'm just not Lula Mae any more.

780
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,591
I'm not.

781
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,297
You know the terrible thing,
Fred, darling?

782
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,091
I am still Lula Mae.

783
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:12,303
Fourteen years old, stealing turkey eggs
and running through a briar patch.

784
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,976
But now I call it having the mean reds.

785
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,403
Well, it's still too
early to go to Tiffany's.

786
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,989
I guess the next best thing is a drink.

787
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,159
Yes, I very much need a drink.

788
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,538
-Will you buy me one, Fred, darling?
-Sure.

789
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:44,168
Only promise me one thing.
Don't take me home until I'm drunk.

790
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,714
Until I'm very drunk indeed.

791
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,252
Do you think she's talented?

792
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:30,214
-Deeply and importantly talented?
-No.

793
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,426
Amusingly and superficially talented,
yes,

794
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:37,388
but deeply and importantly, no.

795
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,953
Gracious.

796
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,790
Do you think she's handsomely paid?

797
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,044
Hmm?

798
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,088
Oh, indeed.

799
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,342
Well, let me tell you something, mister.

800
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,762
If I had her money,
I'd be richer than she is.

801
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:21,224
-How do you figure that?
-Because I'd keep the candy store.

802
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,351
-Hmm?
-Old Sally Tomato.

803
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:24,977
That's my candy store.

804
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,313
I'd always keep Sally.

805
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,149
And that's why I'd be richer than she is.

806
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,401
Mmm-hmm.

807
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,112
We'd better get a little more air.

808
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,375
...Tom, Dick, and Harry. No. Correction.

809
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,003
Every Tom, Dick and Sid,
Harry was his friend.

810
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:56,384
Anyway, every Tom, Dick and Sid
thinks that if he takes a girl to dinner,

811
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:01,013
she'll just curl up like a kitten
in a little furry ball at his feet, right?

812
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,100
I have by actual count
been taken to dinner

813
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,311
by 26 different rats
in the last two months.

814
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,439
Twenty-seven, if you count
Benny Shacklett,

815
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,650
who is in many ways a super-rat.

816
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:16,320
-I think I forgot my key.
-Never mind. I just buzzed Yunioshi.

817
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:17,488
Oh.

818
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,573
-Do you wanna know something funny?
-Mmm-hmm.

819
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,868
In spite of the fact that
most of these rats fork up

820
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,746
$50 for the powder room
like little dolls,

821
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:31,002
I find I have again by actual count
$9 less in the old bank account

822
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,837
than I had six months ago.

823
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,590
So, my darling Fred,

824
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,677
I have tonight
made a very serious decision.

825
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,095
And what is that?

826
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:45,391
No longer will I play the field.

827
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,019
-Congratulations.
-The field stinks,

828
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,521
both economically and socially.

829
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,691
-And I'm giving it up.
-Oh!

830
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,611
Miss Golightly, this time
I'm not only calling the police,

831
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,906
but the fire department and the
New York State Housing Commission,

832
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,409
and, if necessary, the Board of Health!

833
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,370
Quiet up there.
You want to wake the whole house?

834
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:12,209
As Miss Golightly was saying
before she was so rudely interrupted,

835
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,547
Miss Golightly further announces
her intention

836
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,759
to devote
her many considerable talents

837
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:23,220
to the immediate capture,
for the purpose of matrimony

838
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,390
of Mr Rutherford.

839
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:31,437
Rusty to his friends,
of whom I'm sure he has many.

840
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,440
-Trawler.
-Who?

841
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:39,612
Rusty Trawler. You met him at my party
a couple of weeks ago.

842
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,822
He came with Mag Wildwood.

843
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,617
Not the beautiful Latin type.

844
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,244
The other one,
the one that looks like a pig.

845
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:49,789
Remember?

846
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,626
The ninth-richest man in America
under 50?

847
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:57,171
Ah!

848
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,092
Do I detect a look of disapproval
in your eye?

849
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,597
Tough beans, buddy,
'cause that's the way it's gonna be.

850
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,307
-Hi, cat.

851
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,476
Holly, you're drunk.

852
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,603
True.

853
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,608
-Absolutely true. True, but irrelevant.
-What are you doing?

854
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,903
So I think we should have a drink

855
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,781
to the new Mrs Rusty Trawler.

856
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,367
-Me.
-Hey, take it easy.

857
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,538
What's the matter,
don't you think I can do it?

858
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,750
Tell me. Seriously, I'm interested.
Don't you think I can?

859
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,293
You heard the Doc.

860
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,504
My brother gets out of the army
in February

861
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,715
and the Doc won't take him back.
So it's all up to me.

862
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,677
I don't know why you don't understand.

863
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,306
I need money, and I'll do whatever
I have to do to get it.

864
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,308
So,

865
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:56,147
this time next month,
I'll be the new Mrs Rusty Trawler.

866
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,026
And I think we should have
a little drink to that.

867
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,363
It's all gone. Isn't that too bad?

868
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,034
Got any whisky upstairs?

869
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,914
-But you've had enough.
-Go ahead. Get the whisky.

870
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,667
I'll pay you for it.

871
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,840
-Holly, please.
-No, no, you disapprove of me

872
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,760
and I do not accept drinks
from gentlemen who disapprove of me.

873
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,681
I'll pay for my own whisky
and don't you forget it.

874
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,891
Holly.

875
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,186
I do not accept drinks
from disapproving gentlemen.

876
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,732
Especially not disapproving gentlemen
who are kept by other ladies.

877
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,692
So take it.

878
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:46,113
You should be used to taking money
from ladies by now.

879
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,955
If I were you, I'd be more careful
with my money.

880
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,209
Rusty Trawler is too hard a way
of earning it.

881
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:06,133
It should take you exactly four seconds
to cross from here to that door.

882
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,928
I'll give you two.

883
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,171
Hi.

884
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,716
I've come up to talk to you
about the other night,

885
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,676
then I saw the paper, and...

886
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:35,139
Well, actually,
I'm kind of embarrassed about it,

887
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,727
but since it concerns you, I thought
I ought to talk to you about it in person.

888
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,563
What?

889
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,647
Mmm-hmm.

890
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,317
Oh, the earplugs.

891
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,111
I can't go through the whole thing again.

892
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,780
It's sufficient to say,
I've come to make up.

893
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,825
And as an added inducement,
I have all kinds of news.

894
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,160
Can I come in?

895
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:01,248
I guess so. Just a minute.
Do I have a nightgown on?

896
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,793
No, I don't. Would you mind
turning around for a second?

897
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,379
Oh, never mind.
It's such a corny line anyway.

898
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,173
I'll turn around myself.

899
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:10,549
Come in.

900
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,428
Have you seen the paper?

901
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,513
Mmm.

902
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,098
-Rusty, you mean?
-Mmm-hmm.

903
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,517
Yes. I know all about it.

904
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,937
Certainly had him
pegged wrong, didn't I?

905
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,942
I thought he was just a rat,
but he was a super-rat all along.

906
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,029
A super-rat in rat's clothing.

907
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,698
You don't even know the best part.

908
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,618
Not only was he a rat,
or a super-rat, rather,

909
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,329
-he was also broke.

910
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:43,207
Broke. I mean, but not a farthing.

911
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,294
His family has money, of course,
but he personally is broke.

912
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,714
It turns out he owes $700,000.

913
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,468
Can you imagine
anyone owing $700,000?

914
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,804
$43, yes.

915
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,809
Anyway, that's why he decided
to marry the queen of the pig people.

916
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,729
I'll tell you one thing, Fred, darling,

917
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:08,482
I'd marry you for your money
in a minute.

918
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,735
-Would you marry me for my money?
-In a minute.

919
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:16,323
So I guess it's pretty lucky
neither of us is rich, huh?

920
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,616
Yeah.

921
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,995
Fred, darling, I'm so glad to see you.

922
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,002
What have you been doing?

923
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,089
Writing, mostly.

924
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,136
Sold a story. Just got word this morning.

925
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:40,848
Oh, that's marvellous. It really is.

926
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,475
But...

927
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,644
Only how does your decorator friend
feel about it?

928
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,939
I thought you were supposed to be
saving yourself and all of that?

929
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,357
You know something?

930
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:53,193
I haven't got around to telling her
about it yet.

931
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,612
Look, why don't we go out
and have a drink

932
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,531
or take a walk or something
to celebrate?

933
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,699
All right.

934
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,868
I think there's some champagne
in the icebox.

935
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,703
Why don't you open it
while I get dressed?

936
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,829
Okay.

937
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:08,292
I don't think I've ever drunk champagne
before breakfast before.

938
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,670
With breakfast on several occasions.

939
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,589
But never before, before.

940
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,841
Now I've got a wonderful idea.

941
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,385
We can spend a whole day doing things
we've never done before.

942
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,930
We'll take turns. First something
you've never done, then me.

943
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,726
Of course, I can't really think of anything
I've never done.

944
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:33,817
Whoa!

945
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,578
I've never been for a walk
in the morning before.

946
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,705
At least not since I've been in New York.

947
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,290
I've walked up Fifth Avenue at 6:00,

948
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,250
but as far as I'm concerned,
that's still night.

949
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,587
-Do you think it counts?
-Sure it counts. Now we're even.

950
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,853
-Don't you just love it?
-Love what?

951
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,480
Tiffany's.

952
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,575
Isn't it wonderful?

953
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,078
You see what I mean how nothing bad
could ever happen to you

954
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,287
in a place like this?

955
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:31,166
It isn't that I give a hoot about jewellery,
except diamonds, of course.

956
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,627
Like that.

957
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,593
What do you think?

958
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,470
Well...

959
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:49,852
Of course, personally, I think it would be
tacky to wear diamonds before I'm 40.

960
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,272
Well, you're right. But in the meantime,
you should have something.

961
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,773
I'll wait.

962
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,067
No. I'm gonna buy you a present.

963
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,028
You bought me one, a typewriter ribbon,
and it brought me luck.

964
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,197
All right, but Tiffany's can be
pretty expensive.

965
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:04,825
I've got my cheque and $10.

966
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,202
Oh, I wouldn't let you cash your cheque.

967
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,706
But a present for $10 or under,
that I'll accept.

968
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,335
Of course, I don't exactly know what
we're going to find at Tiffany's for $10.

969
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,388
May I help you?

970
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:29,766
Perhaps. Actually, we were looking
for a present for the lady.

971
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,018
Certainly, sir.

972
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,562
Is there something special
you had in mind?

973
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,481
Well, we had considered diamonds.

974
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,442
Now, I don't want to offend you,

975
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,361
but the lady feels
that diamonds are tacky for her.

976
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,407
Oh, I think they're divine
on older women,

977
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,910
but I don't think they'd be right for me.
You do understand?

978
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,036
Certainly.

979
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,498
In all fairness, I think I ought to explain.
There's also a secondary problem.

980
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,666
One of finance.

981
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:58,128
We can only afford to spend
a limited amount.

982
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,506
-May I ask how limited?
-$10.

983
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,217
$10?

984
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,054
That was the outside figure, yes.

985
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,430
I see.

986
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,766
Do you have anything for $10?

987
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,935
Well, frankly, madam,
within that price range,

988
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,812
the variety of merchandise
is rather limited.

989
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,815
However, I do think we might have,
let me see...

990
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,610
Strictly as a novelty, you understand.

991
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,488
For the lady and gentleman
who has everything,

992
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,449
a sterling silver telephone dialler

993
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,619
at $6.75, including tax.

994
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,246
A sterling silver telephone dialler.

995
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,250
Yes, sir. At $6.75, including federal tax.

996
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,545
Well, the price is right, but I must say,

997
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,424
I'd rather hoped for something
slightly more, how shall I say it,

998
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,259
romantic in feeling.

999
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,886
What do you think?

1000
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,013
As sterling silver telephone diallers go,

1001
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:53,642
I certainly think it's handsome,
but, well, you do understand?

1002
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,728
Well, we tried, but I guess...

1003
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,648
We could have something engraved,
couldn't we?

1004
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,149
Yes, I suppose so.

1005
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:02,734
Yes, indeed.

1006
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,446
The only problem is, you would more
or less have to buy something first

1007
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,575
if only in order to have some object
upon which to place the engraving.

1008
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,911
You see the difficulty.

1009
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,579
Well...

1010
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,040
We could have this engraved,
couldn't we?

1011
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,126
I think it would be very smart.

1012
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:23,797
This, I take it, was not
purchased at Tiffany's?

1013
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:24,965
No.

1014
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,801
Actually, it was purchased
concurrent with...

1015
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,512
Well, actually, it came inside of...

1016
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,432
Well, a box of Cracker Jack.

1017
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,891
I see.

1018
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,980
Do they still really have prizes
in Cracker Jack boxes?

1019
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,399
-Oh, yes.
-That's nice to know.

1020
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,695
It gives one a feeling of solidarity,

1021
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,365
almost of continuity with the past,
that sort of thing.

1022
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,826
Do you think Tiffany's
would really engrave it for us?

1023
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,786
I mean, you don't think
they would feel it was beneath them

1024
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,038
or anything like that?

1025
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,248
Well, it is rather unusual, madam.

1026
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,335
But I think you'll find that Tiffany's
is very understanding.

1027
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,421
If you would tell me what initials
you would like,

1028
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,883
I think we could have something
ready for you in the morning.

1029
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,512
Didn't I tell you this was a lovely place?

1030
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,119
What is this place, anyway?

1031
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:39,039
You said you wanted to sit down.
It's the public library.

1032
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,375
-You've never been here?
-No. That makes two for me.

1033
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,378
-I don't see any books.
-They're in there.

1034
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,885
-See?
-Mmm-hmm.

1035
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,518
Each one of these little drawers
is stuffed with little cards.

1036
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,813
And each little card is
a book or an author.

1037
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,689
I think that's fascinating.

1038
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,359
V-A-R-J-A-K.

1039
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,819
Really?

1040
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,282
Look. Isn't it marvellous?

1041
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:17,202
There you are, right in the public library.

1042
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:20,163
"Varjak, Paul. Nine Lives. "

1043
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,290
And then a lot of numbers.

1044
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,960
Do you think they really have
the book itself, live?

1045
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,129
Sure. Follow me.

1046
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,974
-Number 57. That's us.

1047
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,936
Fifty-seven, please.
Nine Lives by Varjak, Paul.

1048
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,229
Shh!

1049
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,106
Did you ever read it?
It's absolutely marvellous.

1050
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,568
-No, I'm afraid I haven't.
-Well, you should. He wrote it.

1051
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,987
He's Varjak, Paul, in person.

1052
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,364
She doesn't believe me.

1053
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:58,368
Show her your driver's licence
or Diner's Club card or something.

1054
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,913
Honest, he really is the author.
Cross my heart and kiss my elbow.

1055
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,082
Would you kindly
lower your voice, miss?

1056
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,876
Why don't you autograph it to them?

1057
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,378
Don't you think it'd be nice?
Sort of make it more personal?

1058
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,838
Really, miss...

1059
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,133
Go ahead. Don't be so stuck up,
autograph it to them.

1060
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,051
All right, what shall I say?

1061
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,679
Something sentimental, I think.

1062
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,599
-What are you doing? Stop that!
-Shh!

1063
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,475
You're defacing public property.

1064
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,477
Well, all right, if that's the way you feel.

1065
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,813
Come on, Fred, darling.
Let's get out of here.

1066
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:29,649
I don't think
this place is half as nice as Tiffany's.

1067
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,333
Hey, did you ever steal anything
from a five-and-ten

1068
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:47,834
when you were a kid, I mean?

1069
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:51,504
No. I'm the sensitive, bookish type.
Did you?

1070
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:55,508
I used to. I still do every now and then,
sort of to keep my hand in.

1071
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,344
Come on. Don't be chicken.

1072
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:00,263
Anyway, you've never done it,
and it's your turn.

1073
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,757
-HOLLY: Boo!

1074
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,267
I can't see.

1075
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,528
Hi, cat.

1076
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,739
Lady of the house at home?

1077
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:33,244
Holly?

1078
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,314
Trick or treat.

1079
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:06,694
You're crazy. You know that, don't you?
But I love you anyway.

1080
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,072
-2-E.
-Yeah?

1081
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,742
I've got to talk to you.

1082
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:14,869
All right.

1083
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,376
You want a drink?

1084
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:22,919
Uh-uh.

1085
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,842
If this is going to be
a serious discussion

1086
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,428
and suddenly I'm terribly afraid it is,

1087
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,598
you're going to have to take off
that ridiculous mask

1088
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,226
or else I'm going to have to
wear one, too.

1089
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,937
2-E, look, please.

1090
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:49,487
What's the matter? Girl trouble?

1091
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,615
Is that it, darling?

1092
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,286
Oh, I see.

1093
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,790
Well, that's not so serious.

1094
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,002
As a matter of fact,
I've been expecting it.

1095
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,963
I can't say I like it,
but I've been expecting it.

1096
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,301
-Who is she?
-Hasn't got anything to do with her.

1097
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,930
This is between you and me.

1098
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:18,141
Oh! Then it is serious.

1099
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:20,810
Well, now.

1100
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,979
2-E, you're a very stylish girl.

1101
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,274
Can't we end this stylishly?

1102
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,320
-End it?
-Yes.

1103
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,489
Well...

1104
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,830
I do believe love has found Andy Hardy.

1105
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,333
Let's see,

1106
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:44,792
a waitress?

1107
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:46,794
A salesgirl?

1108
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:50,340
No. She'd have to be someone rich,
wouldn't she, Paul?

1109
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,676
Someone who could help you.

1110
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,845
Curiously enough,

1111
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:02,143
she's a girl who can't help anyone,
not even herself.

1112
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:07,357
Thing is, I can help her,
and it's a nice feeling for a change.

1113
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,194
All right.

1114
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,238
I understand.

1115
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,327
I'll tell you what, Paul.

1116
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,163
I am a very stylish girl.

1117
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,874
-What are you doing?
-Writing a cheque.

1118
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,587
Don't look so bewildered.

1119
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,382
Surely you've noticed me
writing cheques before.

1120
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:36,052
"Pay to the order
of Paul Varjak, $1 ,000."

1121
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,389
Take her away somewhere for a week.

1122
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,601
You're entitled to a vacation with pay.

1123
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,688
Simply a matter of fair labour practice,
darling.

1124
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,106
Of course, if you were really smart,

1125
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:51,025
you'd get some of the other boys
together and organise a union.

1126
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,736
That way you'd get
all the fringe benefits,

1127
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:56,239
hospitalisation, a pension plan

1128
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,117
and unemployment insurance
when you're,

1129
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,246
how shall I put it,
between engagements?

1130
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,669
Thanks for making it easier for me.

1131
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,797
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

1132
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,924
Take the cheque.

1133
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,801
And call your girl.

1134
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,177
No, thanks.

1135
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,097
I've got a cheque of my own.

1136
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,852
When you get yourself
a new writer to help,

1137
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,187
try and find one my size.

1138
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,983
That way you won't have to even
shorten the sleeves.

1139
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:32,001
Holly!

1140
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:35,129
Hey.

1141
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,215
-What are you doing?
-Excuse me.

1142
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:38,925
Uh...

1143
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,092
I'm sorry.

1144
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,887
You look just like a girl I know
named Holly.

1145
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,013
Really?

1146
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,183
I'm sorry.

1147
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,713
Hi.

1148
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,223
What do you want?

1149
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,309
I want to talk to you.

1150
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:32,979
I'm busy.

1151
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,942
-What are you doing?
-Reading.

1152
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,946
"South America:
Land of Wealth and Promise"?

1153
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,782
It's very interesting.

1154
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:48,244
Let's get out of here.

1155
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,665
I said let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.

1156
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:59,088
What's the matter with you, anyway?
What's happened?

1157
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:03,259
Fred, will you please
just leave me alone?

1158
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:05,136
Holly,

1159
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,263
I love you.

1160
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,939
-Where are you going?
-To the ladies' room.

1161
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,903
-What's the matter with you, anyway?
-Let me go.

1162
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,863
-No.
-Fred, please let me go.

1163
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,281
Let's get something straight.

1164
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,950
I am not now,
nor have I ever been, Fred.

1165
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:29,994
Nor am I Benny Shacklett,
whoever he may be.

1166
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,080
My name is Paul, Paul Varjak,
and I love you.

1167
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:34,832
-Let me go.
-Not till we get this settled.

1168
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,460
Now what's all this jazz
about South America?

1169
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,296
I thought if I'm going to marry
a South American,

1170
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,840
I'd better find out something
about the country.

1171
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:45,718
-Marry? What South American?
-José.

1172
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,471
-Who the hell is José?
-José da Silva Pereira.

1173
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,264
Who the hell’s José da Silva Pereira?

1174
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:53,351
Darling, you met him. I know you did.
Mag Wildwood's friend.

1175
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,312
The tall, good-looking one
who came to the party with Rusty?

1176
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,189
Well, my dear, you won't believe this,

1177
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,567
but it turns out not only is he handsome
and wildly rich,

1178
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:03,569
he's absolutely cuckoo for me.

1179
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,864
-You're crazy.
-What? Do you think you own me?

1180
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:08,366
That's exactly what I think.

1181
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,159
I know, I know.
That's what everybody always thinks,

1182
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,702
but everybody happens to be wrong.

1183
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:13,496
Look, I am not everybody.

1184
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,166
Or am I?

1185
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,170
Is that what you really think?

1186
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:25,883
That I'm no different from
all your other rats and super-rats?

1187
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,177
Wait a minute.

1188
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,346
If that's it,

1189
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,266
if that's what you really think,

1190
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,728
there's something I want to give you.

1191
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:42,483
What's that?

1192
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:44,986
$50 for the powder room.

1193
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,271
I wouldn't ask you in,
except the place is in such a mess

1194
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,024
-I couldn't bear to face it alone.
-You have a message.

1195
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:24,316
No.

1196
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,113
Olé.

1197
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,382
Good evening, Mr Yunioshi.

1198
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,429
Good evening, Paul.

1199
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:58,100
Good evening.

1200
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,284
Please, you must help me.

1201
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:23,876
Holly.

1202
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:25,711
Holly. Holly.

1203
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,177
Holly.

1204
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,137
-Holly. Holly.
-Let me go. No!

1205
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:36,639
Holly.

1206
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:38,891
-Holly.
-Fred. Fred.

1207
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,268
-Holly.

1208
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,998
No, no.

1209
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:11,590
Fred.

1210
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:15,636
Fred.

1211
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,397
-What did you do to her?
-Nothing.

1212
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,691
There was a telegram, and then this.

1213
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:32,027
Crashing everything, conducting
like a crazy. It's appalling.

1214
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:35,197
I can't have a public scandal.
It's too delicate.

1215
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,283
My name, my position, my family.

1216
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,535
Will there be the police again,
do you think?

1217
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:42,955
I don't see why. There's no law against
busting up your own apartment.

1218
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,207
-Where is the telegram?
-There it is.

1219
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,342
"Received notice. Young Fred killed

1220
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,557
"in jeep accident, Fort Riley, Kansas.

1221
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:06,562
"Your husband and children
join in the sorrow of our mutual loss.

1222
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,691
"Letter following. Love, Doc."

1223
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,862
-Her brother Fred.
-Oh.

1224
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,908
This brother,
was she very close to him?

1225
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,075
Yeah.

1226
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,247
What can one do?

1227
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,541
Try to help her.

1228
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,002
I tried. It didn't do much good.

1229
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,423
You got a ranch or something
down in Brazil, don't you?

1230
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,549
Yes.

1231
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,761
That's good. She'll like that.

1232
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,766
Well, you better get in there.

1233
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,231
-Hi.
-Hello.

1234
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:17,359
Got your wire.
How did you know where to reach me?

1235
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,611
Oh, I tried everything.
Called people, asked around

1236
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:21,488
and suddenly thought of looking
in the phone book.

1237
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,615
Anyway, I'm glad you could come.

1238
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,162
-You look fine.
-You think so?

1239
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,581
I'm fat as a pig, and I haven't had
my hair done in months.

1240
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,625
But I'm happy, really happy.
It probably shows.

1241
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,295
You look très distingué yourself.

1242
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,172
I got a job. I've been writing a little.

1243
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:40,007
I know. I've read three of your stories.

1244
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:43,385
Two in The New Yorker
and one in that funny little magazine.

1245
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,598
Won't you sit down?

1246
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,932
Thank you.

1247
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,727
-I've taken up knitting.
-So I see.

1248
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:57,107
It'll probably look very nice
once it's finished.

1249
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:58,817
Actually, I'm a little nervous about it.

1250
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:01,820
José brought up the blueprints
for a new ranch house he's building

1251
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:02,946
and I have this strange feeling

1252
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:05,657
that maybe the blueprints and
my knitting instructions got switched.

1253
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:09,036
I mean, it isn't impossible
that I'm knitting a ranch house.

1254
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:21,465
Really, darling, I can't tell you
how divinely happy I am.

1255
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,468
What is that, anyhow?

1256
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,471
Portuguese.
A very complicated language.

1257
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,640
Four thousand irregular verbs.

1258
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:38,315
Hmm. Very impressive. What's it mean?

1259
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,110
"I believe you are in league
with the butcher."

1260
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,740
Holly, what's this about?

1261
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,285
Why did you want to see me?

1262
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:52,788
José's in Washington for the night

1263
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:55,541
so I thought if I asked you over,
you might come.

1264
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:59,002
And, well, I've said goodbye
to everyone else I care about.

1265
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,504
You're going somewhere?

1266
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:01,922
I'm going to Rio tomorrow.

1267
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:04,800
I've got the plane ticket,
and I've even said goodbye to old Sally.

1268
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:06,135
José is flying down with you?

1269
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,011
We're going on separate planes,
of course.

1270
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,806
He doesn't think it would look right
for us to be travelling together.

1271
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,391
His family's very important down there,

1272
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,476
so he has to worry
about things like that.

1273
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:17,187
Anyway, I thought I'd show off
and cook dinner for us.

1274
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,856
It'll be fun eating in.

1275
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,192
Did I tell you how divinely
and utterly happy I am?

1276
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,402
Yes.

1277
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,904
You are getting married, then?

1278
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,658
Well, he hasn't really asked me,
not in so many words.

1279
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:30,993
Four, you mean?

1280
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,161
Huh?

1281
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:35,164
Well, that's how many words it takes.

1282
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,833
-"Will you marry me?"

1283
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,669
Oh, we'll get married, all right.
I know we will.

1284
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:43,755
And in church and with his family there
and everything.

1285
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,009
And that's why he's waiting
till we get to Rio, probably.

1286
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,514
Do you think it's trying
to tell us something?

1287
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:56,518
I hope you like chicken and saffron rice
served with chocolate sauce.

1288
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,437
It's an East Indian classic, my dear.

1289
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:01,023
Three months ago,
I couldn't scramble eggs.

1290
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:06,487
Are you all right? Oh!

1291
01:37:07,197 --> 01:37:10,365
Golly, darling.
I did so want to impress you.

1292
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:11,533
Look,

1293
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:14,786
I'm not much for chicken with sauce,
anyway.

1294
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:18,373
Why don't we go out somewhere?
Let me buy you a farewell dinner.

1295
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:22,127
That would be fun, as long as
it's someplace I can go like this.

1296
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:31,386
Years from now,

1297
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:34,389
years and years, I'll be back.

1298
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:37,392
Me and my nine Brazilian brats.

1299
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,313
They'll be dark like José, of course,

1300
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,233
but they'll have
bright, green, beautiful eyes.

1301
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:50,364
I'll bring them back, all right,
'cause they must see this.

1302
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,242
Oh, I love New York.

1303
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:56,537
Then why are you leaving?
What's in it for you, anyway?

1304
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,916
Look, I know what you're thinking,
and I don't blame you.

1305
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,752
I've always thrown out such a jazzy line.

1306
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:08,674
Really, except for Doc and yourself,
José's my first non-rat romance.

1307
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:12,427
Not that he's my idea
of the absolute finito.

1308
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:15,931
He's too prim and cautious
to be my absolute ideal.

1309
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:20,602
Now if I could choose
from anybody alive, I wouldn't pick José.

1310
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,854
Nehru, maybe, or Albert Schweitzer.

1311
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,274
Or Leonard Bernstein.

1312
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:29,361
But I am mad about José.

1313
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:32,281
I honestly think I'd give up smoking
if he asked me.

1314
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:38,120
Come on, darling, let's eat.
It's getting late.

1315
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:42,958
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I haven't even begun to pack.

1316
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:07,399
Didn't want José to think I was
the kind of girl who loses her key,

1317
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,276
so I had 26 of them made.

1318
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:11,987
No, wait. I got a better idea.

1319
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:13,822
Kind of a farewell gesture.

1320
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,326
Somebody must have tripped the lock.

1321
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,995
Crafty devil, that Yunioshi.

1322
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,497
Wake up, wake up!
The British are coming!

1323
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:24,750
-Or, in this case, the Brazilians.
-Exactly.

1324
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:27,753
-Exactly.
-I've still got to clean up all that rice.

1325
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:30,631
Hey, you know...

1326
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:31,840
Hey!

1327
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:37,304
Ah! There she are who did it!
The wanted woman! There!

1328
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:40,766
Groenburger. Narcotics squad.

1329
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,685
-What do you mean?
-What's going on?

1330
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:45,437
-Why don't you ask your boss?
-What boss?

1331
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,106
Sally Tomato. Why don't you ask him?
Come on.

1332
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:52,152
Look around for narcotic.
They got plenty narcotic in there.

1333
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,048
-What's your name?
-Varjak.

1334
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,466
Hold it down over there!

1335
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,302
Paul Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1336
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:19,221
-Hey!
-Oh, get lost, will you?

1337
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:20,389
Get out!

1338
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,224
I'm a writer.

1339
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,685
W-R-I-T-E-R.

1340
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:32,984
-Please. One, one, please.
-One at a time. Please, one.

1341
01:40:33,403 --> 01:40:34,569
Good.

1342
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:38,490
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-I can't answer all your questions.

1343
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:41,076
-Just one at a time.
-Knock it off!

1344
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:44,788
Now, darling, why don't you start?

1345
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,957
Is it true you carried messages
from Tomato in code?

1346
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,166
Of course not.

1347
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,293
I'd just meet Mr O'Shaughnessy
at Hamburger Heaven

1348
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,503
and give him the weather report.

1349
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,839
Simply do not ask me what this is
all about.

1350
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:56,800
But you did used to visit Tomato?

1351
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:58,844
I used to see him every week.
What's wrong with that?

1352
01:40:58,928 --> 01:41:01,179
Well, you must've known Tomato was
part of the narcotics syndicate.

1353
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:02,848
Mr Tomato never mentioned
narcotics to me.

1354
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,851
It makes me furious the way all these
wretched people keep persecuting him.

1355
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,936
He's a deeply sensitive person.

1356
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,480
-A darling old man.
-Then you're innocent.

1357
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:12,524
-Of course I'm innocent.
-What are you going to do about it?

1358
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:15,152
-What do you mean?
-Well, who's your lawyer?

1359
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,611
I don't know.

1360
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,989
Mr O'Shaughnessy, I guess.

1361
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:21,783
Mr O'Shaughnessy!

1362
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,162
Hey! Get out of here!

1363
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,622
-All right, come on.
-Okay, move.

1364
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,083
-Come on, then.
-Mr O'Shaughnessy?

1365
01:41:30,168 --> 01:41:32,335
-Shut up!
-Get in there.

1366
01:41:54,484 --> 01:41:56,693
-Yeah.
-WOMAN: Mr Paul Varjak?

1367
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:59,654
-Yeah.
-Ready with Mr Berman in Hollywood.

1368
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:03,825
Kindly deposit $3
for the first 3 minutes, please.

1369
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,171
Hello?

1370
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,840
O.J. Berman here. Who's calling?

1371
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:23,011
-Mr Berman, this is Paul Varjak.
-Nice to talk to you, kid.

1372
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:26,515
Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1373
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,893
I'm a friend of Holly's.
I met you at a party in New York.

1374
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:33,980
-Who?
-Paul. Paul Varjak.

1375
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:35,524
V-A-R...

1376
01:42:37,235 --> 01:42:39,528
Mr Berman, this is Fred.

1377
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:41,571
Oh, Fred baby, huh?

1378
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:43,907
So you're calling about the kid, huh?

1379
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:47,536
Everything's under control. Just relax.

1380
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:51,081
I spoke to my lawyer in New York.

1381
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:53,917
I told him to take care of everything,
send me the bill

1382
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:55,418
but to keep my name anomynous.

1383
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:58,380
-What?
-Unknown. I don't want any part of it.

1384
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,925
-You hear me?
-You sound like you're in a tunnel.

1385
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:03,009
Ah.

1386
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,178
It's this executive phone I have.

1387
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:07,264
-What?
-Executive phone!

1388
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:10,767
Fred baby, they only got her
on $10,000 bail.

1389
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:15,063
My lawyer can get her out at 10:00
this morning. I'll tell you what you do.

1390
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,899
You bust into that dump she lives in,

1391
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,860
collect all her junk.

1392
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:21,736
Go down to the jail. Get her out.

1393
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:25,073
Take her straight over to a hotel
under a phoney name, right?

1394
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,784
You wanna keep away from
the reporters as much as possible.

1395
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,661
Do you know what I mean?
Will you do that?

1396
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:31,121
Sure, Mr Berman.

1397
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,624
-I can't tell you how much I appreciate...
-Forget it.

1398
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:37,043
I owe her something.

1399
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:42,549
Not that I owe her anything, I mean,
if you really get right down to it,

1400
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,385
but she's a crazy.

1401
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,097
She's a phoney.

1402
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:52,434
But she's a real phoney.

1403
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:56,605
-Know what I mean, kid?
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

1404
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,275
-Thanks, Mr Berman. Thanks a lot.
-Right!

1405
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,743
Why don't you behave?

1406
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:23,632
Quel night.

1407
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:40,482
I did a little housebreaking
while you were away.

1408
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,443
Clayton Hotel, driver. 84th and Madison.

1409
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:48,615
O.J. thinks it'd be a good idea
if you stayed out of sight for a while.

1410
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:52,452
I got most of your stuff here,
including cat. Hope he's all right.

1411
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,162
Yeah.

1412
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,455
Hello, cat.

1413
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,499
Poor no-name slob.

1414
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,671
Listen, darling.
Did you find that plane ticket?

1415
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:06,174
-Right here. We can cash it in.
-Cash it in? Are you kidding?

1416
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:08,009
What time is it?

1417
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:10,220
-A little after 10:00.
-Good.

1418
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,597
Idlewild Airport, please, driver.

1419
01:45:12,682 --> 01:45:15,350
-Never mind. You can't do that.
-Why not?

1420
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:18,061
You don't understand.
You're under indictment.

1421
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,231
If they catch you jumping bail, they'll
lock you up and throw away the key.

1422
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:22,899
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

1423
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,067
By the day after tomorrow,

1424
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,277
I'll be married to the future president
of Brazil.

1425
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:29,364
And that'll give me diplomatic immunity
or something.

1426
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:32,450
I wouldn't bet on it.

1427
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,078
What is it, darling?

1428
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:39,916
-Message for you.
-Oh.

1429
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,210
Oh, yes, I see.

1430
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:45,005
Did he bring it in person, or was it

1431
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,465
just there, shoved under the door?

1432
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:48,800
A cousin.

1433
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:54,055
Hand me my purse, will you, darling?

1434
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,600
A girl can't read that sort of thing
without her lipstick.

1435
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,313
You read it to me, will you, darling?

1436
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:04,649
I don't think I can quite bear...

1437
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,235
-Sure you want me to?
-Mmm-hmm.

1438
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:12,240
Okay.

1439
01:46:13,743 --> 01:46:15,452
"My dearest little girl,

1440
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:19,122
"I have loved you knowing
you were not as others.

1441
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:20,790
"But conceive of my despair

1442
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:23,960
"upon discovering in such a brutal
and public style

1443
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:27,672
"how very different you are
from the manner of woman

1444
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:30,592
"a man of my position
could hope to make his wife.

1445
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:36,097
"I grieve for the disgrace
of your present circumstances.

1446
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:38,141
"And I do not find it in my heart

1447
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,143
"to add my condemn

1448
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,771
"to the condemn that surrounds you.

1449
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:47,776
"So I hope you will find it in your heart
not to condemn me.

1450
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:50,945
"I have my family to protect
and my name

1451
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:55,200
"and I am a coward where
these institutions enter.

1452
01:46:56,494 --> 01:47:00,830
"Forget me, beautiful child.
And may God be with you.

1453
01:47:01,123 --> 01:47:02,332
"José."

1454
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:05,835
Well?

1455
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:10,048
Well, at least he's honest.

1456
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:13,051
-It's kind of touching.
-Touching?

1457
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,886
That square-ball jazz.

1458
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:18,139
He says he's a coward.

1459
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:22,143
All right. So he's not a regular rat
or even a super-rat.

1460
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:24,729
He's just a scared little mouse,
that's all.

1461
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:27,524
But, oh, golly.

1462
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:29,692
Gee, damn.

1463
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:38,034
Well, so much for South America.

1464
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:43,915
I didn't really think you were cut out
to be queen of the Pampas, anyway.

1465
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,668
-Clayton Hotel.
-Idlewild.

1466
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:48,503
What?

1467
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:51,756
The plane leaves at 12:00.
And on it I plan to be.

1468
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:53,216
Holly, you can't.

1469
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:59,889
I'm not hotfooting it after José,
if that's what you think. Oh, no.

1470
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:03,518
As far as I'm concerned,
he's the future president of nowhere.

1471
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:05,937
Only why should I waste
a perfectly good plane ticket?

1472
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:08,189
Besides, I've never been to Brazil.

1473
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,361
Please, darling, don't sit there
looking at me like that.

1474
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,072
I'm going and that's all there is to it.

1475
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:18,616
Now all they want from me

1476
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:21,411
are my services as the state's witness
against Sally.

1477
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:24,289
Nobody has any intention
of prosecuting me.

1478
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:27,250
To begin with,
they don't have a ghost of a chance.

1479
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:30,962
Even so, this town's finished for me.

1480
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:32,547
At least for a while.

1481
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:37,886
There are certain shades of limelight
that can wreck a girl’s complexion.

1482
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,763
They'll have the rope up
at every saloon in town.

1483
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,641
I'll tell you what you do for me, darling.

1484
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:44,893
When you get back to town,

1485
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:48,104
I want you to call up the
New York Times or whoever you call.

1486
01:48:48,189 --> 01:48:51,566
I want you to mail me a list
of the 50 richest men in Brazil.

1487
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:52,942
The 50 richest.

1488
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:59,282
-Holly, I'm not going to let you do this.
-You're not going to let me?

1489
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:01,492
Holly, I'm in love with you.

1490
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:03,703
-So what?
-So what?

1491
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:05,788
So plenty.

1492
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:09,250
-I love you. You belong to me.
-No.

1493
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:12,045
-People don't belong to people.
-Of course they do.

1494
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:14,005
I'm not gonna let anyone
put me in a cage.

1495
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:16,341
I don't want to put you in a cage.
I want to love you.

1496
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:18,843
-It's the same thing.
-No, it's not.

1497
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,720
-Holly...
-I'm not Holly.

1498
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,097
I'm not Lula Mae, either.
I don't know who I am.

1499
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,390
I'm like cat, here.

1500
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,809
We're a couple of no-name slobs.
We belong to nobody.

1501
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:30,230
And nobody belongs to us.
We don't even belong to each other.

1502
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:32,440
Stop the cab.

1503
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:40,031
What do you think?

1504
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:43,284
This ought to be the right kind of place
for a tough guy like you.

1505
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,703
-Garbage cans, rats galore.

1506
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:46,829
Scram!

1507
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:49,707
I said take off! Beat it!

1508
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,209
Let's go.

1509
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:04,597
Driver,

1510
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:08,893
pull over here.

1511
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:20,863
You know what's wrong with you,
Miss Whoever-you-are?

1512
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,908
You're chicken. You've got no guts.

1513
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:27,078
You're afraid to stick out your chin
and say, "Okay, life's a fact."

1514
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:28,621
People do fall in love.

1515
01:50:28,706 --> 01:50:30,581
People do belong to each other

1516
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:33,960
because that's the only chance
anybody's got for real happiness.

1517
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:37,297
You call yourself a free spirit,
a wild thing.

1518
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,717
And you're terrified somebody's
going to stick you in a cage.

1519
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:44,637
Well, baby, you're already in that cage.
You built it yourself.

1520
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,806
And it's not bounded in the west
by Tulip, Texas

1521
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,308
or in the east by Somaliland.

1522
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,851
It's wherever you go.

1523
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:53,896
Because no matter where you run,
you just end up running into yourself.

1524
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,699
Here. I've been carrying this thing
around for months.

1525
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:06,993
I don't want it any more.

1526
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,255
Here, cat!

1527
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:03,132
Cat!

1528
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:14,227
Where's the cat?

1529
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:16,896
I don't know.

1530
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:34,497
Cat!

1531
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:38,167
Cat!

1532
01:52:38,919 --> 01:52:45,550
Cat!

1533
01:52:50,472 --> 01:52:58,771
Cat.

1534
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:27,508
Cat.
