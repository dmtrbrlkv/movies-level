1
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,020
Wow, it was barely an 
inch when we went in.

2
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:02,564
It's so beautiful.

3
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,093
It's good, it's good, it's good.

4
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:35,597
I can't feel my fingers.

5
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:39,935
Thank you.

6
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:57,869
...do anything for love

7
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,372
You do not like this song.

8
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,958
I would do anything for love

9
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,503
I would do anything for love

10
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,088
You have to turn it off.

11
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:09,965
But I won't do that

12
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,427
Oh, no, I won't...

13
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:19,266
I'm married to a cheeser! Please, stop!

14
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,852
- You love it. Say you love it.
- Stop!

15
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,395
Stop it!

16
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,982
- You love that song.
- Oh, Leo.

17
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,569
Hey, I have this theory.

18
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,073
That a girl's guaranteed to get 
preggers if she does it in a car.

19
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,744
What?

20
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:45,250
I have a theory, too.
My theory is about moments.

21
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,795
Moments of impact.

22
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,189
My theory is that these 
moments of impact,

23
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,653
these flashes of high intensity that 
completely turn our lives upside down,

24
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:57,489
actually end up defining who we are.

25
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,787
Thanks.

26
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,038
Next in line.

27
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:15,048
One of my absolute favorite moments.

28
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,224
You forgot your permit.

29
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:29,980
Yeah. Well, I just sort of come 
here to enjoy the two-hour line.

30
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,565
The permit's sort of a bonus.

31
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,112
The Art Institute.

32
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,866
- You work there?
- No, I'm a student.

33
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:46,788
I'm Paige.

34
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:49,374
I'm sorry. I'm Leo.

35
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,377
Well, thank you for this, Leo.

36
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:57,257
You know what, I noticed,
in a totally non-threatening way,

37
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,217
we have the same RPP zone.

38
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:01,136
Is that right?

39
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,054
Yup.

40
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:08,810
- You have impressive powers of observation.
- Yes.

41
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:11,229
What's an RPP zone?

42
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,899
Residential permit parking zone.

43
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,154
That sounds intimate.

44
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:21,907
Yeah.

45
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,076
Okay.

46
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:28,330
What I was thinking is that...

47
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,750
I think we owe it to ourselves, 
eally, to maybe get a drink,

48
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,837
out of respect for our 
zone compatibility and all.

49
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:41,593
- Okay_
- Okay?

50
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,180
All right, okay.

51
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,186
After you.

52
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,362
Pick a hand. Pick a hand. Pick a hand.

53
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,280
- That one.
- Here we go.

54
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,786
This is good.

55
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,640
Let me know if you need anything else.

56
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,502
- Did you just fart?
- No.

57
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,049
Maybe a little.

58
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,389
That is so twisted.

59
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,643
But totally romantic.

60
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:59,314
God, I'm so in love with you, it's insane.

61
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:08,156
As you know, your wife's CT scan
showed intracranial hemorrhaging.

62
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,950
We purposely keep patients
with traumatic brain injuries

63
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,703
in a comatose state in 
order to calm their systems

64
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:18,166
and allow the brain time to heal itself
while the swelling subsides.

65
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,086
And then we slowly 
wean them off it. Now...

66
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,673
The thing is,
each one of us is the sum total of

67
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:27,634
every moment that 
we've ever experienced,

68
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:30,428
with all the people we've ever known.

69
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,653
And it's these moments
that become our history.

70
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:50,865
Like our own personal greatest hits
of memories that we play

71
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:54,244
and replay in our minds 
over and over again.

72
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,167
Aren't you hungry?

73
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,837
- Hey.
- Hi.

74
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,589
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

75
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:07,882
- Really?
- No.

76
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,509
- What's that?
- Nothing.

77
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,511
Nothing? Food's ready.

78
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:17,517
Look, if you keep feeding that fleabag,
it's gonna keep coming back and I'm allergic.

79
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:20,311
Like you claim to be allergic to cilantro?

80
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,690
- I can't stand cilantro.
- Exactly. But you're not allergic.

81
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:26,151
Does anybody want strawberries
I bought at the farmers' market?

82
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,445
- Buying groceries, bad sign.
- What?

83
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:30,822
- And we all know what that means.
- I like her.

84
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,074
She's like our mascot.

85
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:34,701
Thanks, I think.

86
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,454
I would rather have her than that 
ferret you tried to make us adopt.

87
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:41,040
- And she makes great coffee. Let's keep her.
- Thank you.

88
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,001
- Have some.
- Thank you.

89
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,796
"Movie"? I think you spelled "movie" wrong.

90
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,089
No.

91
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,557
Told you.

92
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,017
Yes.

93
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:07,192
I vow to help you love life,
to always hold you with tenderness,

94
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,695
and to have the patience that love demands.

95
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,448
To speak when words are needed

96
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,701
and to share the silence when they're not.

97
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,914
To agree to disagree on red velvet cake.

98
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:26,711
And to live within the warmth of 
your heart and always call it home.

99
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,423
Wow, you set the bar kind of high.

100
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,426
Did you write your vows on a menu?

101
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,054
Yeah. Why?

102
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,816
I vow to fiercely love you

103
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,737
in all your forms, now and forever.

104
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:58,159
I promise to never forget that 
this is a once-in-a-lifetime love.

105
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:04,123
And to always know in the 
deepest part of my soul

106
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,420
that no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,

107
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:13,925
that we'll always find the 
way back to each other.

108
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,348
Do you take each other 
as spouses forever?

109
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,766
I do.

110
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:25,770
I do.

111
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:31,442
Then by the power vested in 
me by the State of Illinois, I...

112
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:32,986
Security.

113
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,155
I now pronounce you man and 
wife and best friends for life.

114
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,615
Kiss! Run!

115
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,593
I have one piece. One piece.

116
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,680
It's... It's not happening.

117
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,849
I don't...

118
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,851
Oh, my God.

119
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:50,396
- You're gonna be fine.
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to call them.

120
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,691
I'm gonna have to call them
and tell them that I can't do it.

121
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,446
Come to bed with me.

122
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,117
Come on. I know you 
wanna come to bed with me.

123
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:06,037
Don't!

124
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,956
Oh, no, please, no.

125
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,880
Stop it!

126
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,760
I think this one's coming along fine.

127
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:26,099
I mean, I know it's not finished,
but I'm already starting to see a mood.

128
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:31,062
It's got like a darkening 
curtain thing happening there,

129
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:35,066
and then a competing light element, there.

130
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:41,280
It's abstract, but, I mean, I don't know,
I kind of think it's already powerful.

131
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,492
What?

132
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,328
You totally love me.

133
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,081
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

134
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:54,335
I know because this is my piece,

135
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,965
and that's the scrap pile,

136
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,635
which I'm now saving.

137
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,973
A moment of total physical, mental,
and every other kind of love.

138
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,483
Don't crowd her.

139
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:03,362
She's gonna be a little groggy,
so let's just give her some space.

140
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,656
Hey.

141
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,667
It's so good to see you.

142
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,214
Paige?

143
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,383
It's okay. You're in the hospital.

144
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:28,429
You were in a car accident.
You hit your head, but you're okay.

145
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:31,265
We just kept you asleep for a little while.

146
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,017
How do you feel?

147
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,854
My head hurts.

148
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,318
Yeah, well, that's perfectly normal.
I'll get you something for that.

149
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,695
Was anyone else hurt, Doctor?

150
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,040
Paige, you know who I am, right?

151
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:58,584
Yeah. You're my doctor.

152
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,646
I'm your husband.

153
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,110
Paige?

154
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,047
- Mr. Collins?
- You said things were very good.

155
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:47,800
A brain injury isn't like
a broken bone or a laceration.

156
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,260
Brains are much less predictable.

157
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,555
Sometimes, due to the way the 
swelling tissue presses against the skull,

158
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,391
-it can cause some impairment.
- Some impairment?

159
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,601
She doesn't remember me.

160
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:00,563
Even though she's awake, the swelling
can cause confusion or memory loss,

161
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,939
erratic mood swings.

162
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,275
- What?
- But that's normal.

163
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,619
So, that's my theory.

164
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:18,331
That these moments of 
impact define who we are.

165
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,711
But what I never considered

166
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:28,507
was what if, one day, you could 
no longer remember any of them?

167
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,482
Hi.

168
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,985
- What are you up to?
- Sleeping.

169
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,656
Right.

170
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,407
I brought you some clothes.

171
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,826
Thank you.

172
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,499
I'm kind of hungry.

173
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,918
Okay.

174
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,172
Come on.

175
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:15,221
So, I just wanted to verify
a few things with you about me,

176
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:16,847
about us.

177
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,350
- Great.
- So, we're married?

178
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:20,893
- Yes.
- Yeah.

179
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,937
And I have weird hair.

180
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,731
I think that's taking a narrow view.

181
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,609
You said it takes too long to straighten

182
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:30,695
and you'd rather use that time
to work in your studio.

183
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,531
My studio? Why do I have a studio?

184
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,410
You're an artist.

185
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,079
Sculptor. A really good one.

186
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,667
Right now, you're working on four 
pieces for the Tribune Tower lobby,

187
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,127
which is huge.

188
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,587
Everyone in town 
wanted that commission.

189
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:52,591
But your show at the MCA's 12 x 12
was amazing, so you won it.

190
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,760
What about my law degree?

191
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:59,307
I don't have a law degree?

192
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:02,476
I think you were a few credits shy.

193
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:08,399
Last time I wanted to be an artist,
I was in high school.

194
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,821
I think you need to look at it like a win.

195
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,073
- Traumatic brain injury is a win?
- You're an idiot.

196
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,868
If she doesn't remember who you are,

197
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,287
then she doesn't remember
all the stupid shit you ever did.

198
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,913
You can start over, wipe the slate clean.

199
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,499
I'm just worried if she 
doesn't remember you,

200
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,002
how's she going to remember
she's in love with you? What?

201
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,296
I was frankly a little stunned
she went for you the first time.

202
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,089
If anything, you've 
become less attractive.

203
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,301
You guys are a great support system.

204
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:40,765
Seriously, though.
What if she doesn't remember me?

205
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,641
Then what?

206
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:50,316
She's gonna remember you.
She's gonna remember all of us.

207
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:51,692
We're her family.

208
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,114
Yeah, you're right.

209
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,596
Excuse me.
I'm looking for my wife, Paige Collins.

210
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,889
She was right over here yesterday.

211
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:24,725
Well, it looks like they moved 
her up to the VIP floor.

212
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,895
- That sounds expensive.
- It's a donor's wing.

213
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:31,899
Just go down here and take the elevator
to the second floor and make a right.

214
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,526
Okay. Thanks.

215
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,741
Paige, your long-term 
memory recall is intact

216
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:45,204
and I'm very optimistic the rest of your
memory is going to improve with time.

217
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,332
Mr. Collins, I'm so glad you're here.

218
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,838
This is bizarre. I'm Leo, Paige's husband.

219
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,426
Do you know how disconcerting
it was to hear second-hand

220
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,220
that my daughter had 
been in the ICU for weeks

221
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,347
and we hadn't been told?

222
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,600
- You should have called us.
- I'm sorry.

223
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,229
You've never met my parents?

224
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,356
I don't understand.
Why haven't you met him?

225
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,442
So, Doctor, now what is the next step?

226
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:19,530
The sooner she settles back into her life,
her normal routine, the better.

227
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,157
Starting in a week or so,
I'm gonna recommend

228
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,075
that Paige see a neural psychologist.

229
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,702
- Okay.
- Whatever she needs.

230
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,580
Therapy, specialists,
I'll make sure she gets the best.

231
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:29,457
You'll come home where 
I can take care of you.

232
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,544
Mom can make up your old room,
and I can take some time off work.

233
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:38,132
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
'cause we really appreciate that,

234
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:40,384
but you just heard Paige's doctor say

235
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:43,012
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine.

236
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,181
Her life with me is her normal routine.

237
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,475
Yes, but that's a life 
she doesn't remember.

238
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,060
She will. That's what her doctor
just got through saying.

239
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:53,063
No. What she said was that
maybe Paige will remember.

240
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:57,359
Now, why not let her come home
and recover with people that she knows?

241
00:21:57,443 --> 00:22:00,404
- And loves?
- We're only trying to do the best for Paige.

242
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,448
That's interesting, 'cause you
haven't even asked her once.

243
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,450
- Well, no, but...
- What I really need is for everyone

244
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,285
to just stop bickering!

245
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,289
Listen, none of this needs
to be decided right now.

246
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,457
No. Sorry.

247
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,918
I think you should all head
home, get some rest.

248
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,086
I'm sure everyone could use it.

249
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,131
How is it that you're my husband
and you've never met my family?

250
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,927
You haven't spoken to them in years.

251
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,181
Why would I ever stop
speaking to my family?

252
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,600
It all went down before we met.

253
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,937
- And we never talked about it?
- No, we did.

254
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:35,981
So?

255
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,445
For starters, you wanted to move 
into the city and go to the Art Institute.

256
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,533
And your father insisted
that you stay in law school.

257
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,285
He had some pretty strict views
on what you ought to be doing.

258
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,622
Things just spiraled from there.

259
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,001
Okay. Look, what I remember
is being in law school

260
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,879
and being engaged to Jeremy.

261
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:05,052
I... I don't know.

262
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,310
Paige.

263
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:16,313
Okay, babe, babe, just, just...

264
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:23,571
The best thing to do at this point
is to go back to your life with me.

265
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,199
You heard what the doctor said.
It's the best thing for your recovery.

266
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,493
Okay, but I don't know you.

267
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:33,914
And I'm just supposed to get in your 
car and go and live at your place?

268
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,376
- It's our place.
- Without any proof of us even being in love?

269
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,544
Other than our marriage?

270
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,588
People get married for all 
kinds of different reasons.

271
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,507
- Okay. Like?
- Like for a green card.

272
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,260
I'm from Cincinnati.

273
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:49,555
Did I keep a journal?

274
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,891
No, not that I know of.

275
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,284
I guess this is all he could find.

276
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,829
Oh, well. It looks fine, honey.

277
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,748
I mean, we're just going home, so...

278
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,541
- It's horrible...
- Paige?

279
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,377
I understand you're finally leaving us.

280
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:23,047
Yes, that's what they tell me.

281
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,636
So, no driving until I give you the say-so.

282
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:31,555
But other than that, I'm gonna 
see you in four to six weeks.

283
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,182
- All right?
- Thank you so much.

284
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,309
- Thank you, Doctor, for everything.
- Thank you, Doctor.

285
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,102
- Okay.
- You ready? Let's go.

286
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,898
Wait, hold on. I got a voice-mail.
It's from before the accident.

287
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:46,904
- You said you wanted evidence.
- Okay, yeah. Well, let's have a listen.

288
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,782
Hey, baby.

289
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,327
I'm sorry, I'm still at my studio.

290
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,122
I miss you so bad my sculptures 
are starting to look like you.

291
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,917
So, what are you doing later?

292
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:03,671
I kind of need some Leo time,
if you know what I mean.

293
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,175
Yeah. Anyway, call me back.

294
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:10,427
Love you.

295
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:19,144
I don't know, I guess in listening back 
to it, it doesn't exactly prove anything.

296
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,938
No, no, it's...

297
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,693
It's cute. I mean, I sound happy.

298
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,280
Okay, look. Think about it.

299
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,534
You quit law school,
you broke off your engagement

300
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:34,952
and you moved into the city.

301
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:39,665
Those were all choices that you made,
way before you even met me.

302
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,959
I think that you owe it to yourself

303
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,713
to honor those decisions,
at least for right now.

304
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,342
This is a mistake, Paige.

305
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,970
I promise that I will take care of her.

306
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:57,224
Please, come home with me.
Come home with me.

307
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,309
We'll figure this out together.

308
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,569
I guess I could just try it out

309
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:12,990
to see if it would help my memory and...

310
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:17,035
I could always come home
if I change my mind.

311
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,664
I married him.
It must have been for some reason.

312
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,668
- A guarded endorsement.
- But I will take it.

313
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,847
I look like a freak.

314
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,350
I think you look great.

315
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:49,026
- Where do we live?
- On the north side.

316
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,407
Who's the president?

317
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,534
- Of the country?
- Yeah.

318
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,536
Obama.

319
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,914
The senator?

320
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,542
Yeah. You voted for him.

321
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:07,044
I did?

322
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,642
Welcome home.

323
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:25,979
After you.

324
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,487
Surprise!

325
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,078
It's good to see you.

326
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:44,331
We were there every day at the hospital,
but Leo didn't want us to overwhelm you.

327
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:47,668
- Yeah. They were. Every day.
- We really missed you.

328
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,754
I gather we're close?

329
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,926
I'm Sonia. And this is my boyfriend Kyle.

330
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,428
- Hey, Paige.
- And this is Jim.

331
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,765
- You look great, Paige.
- And Lily.

332
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,601
Hey. What, were you, like,
working out at the hospital?

333
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,770
- Hey, Paige.
- And Josh.

334
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:10,315
I... Sorry, I... Excuse me.

335
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,990
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sorry it ended early.

336
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,450
It's all right. Take care, Leo.

337
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,231
Are you okay?

338
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,150
What do you think?

339
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,987
I know. It's a lot to take in.

340
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:58,822
No.

341
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:03,160
A lot to take in would've 
been coming home,

342
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:07,664
to a strange apartment,
with a man I don't know.

343
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,209
That would be a lot to take in.

344
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,006
But coming home to all of that,
plus a house full of people

345
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,469
pulling on me, and hugging me,
and crying in my face,

346
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,804
and talking about more shit
that I don't remember,

347
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:26,016
that's not a lot to take in, 
that's total bullshit.

348
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,518
You're right.

349
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,520
It was only supposed to be a few people.

350
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,940
Will you please just get out?

351
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:40,364
Paige, I'm sorry.

352
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,950
Are you honestly not 
gonna leave me alone?

353
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,452
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

354
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,704
Of course.

355
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,544
I'm sorry.

356
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:45,095
Oh, my God. Oh, my mother's gonna kill me.

357
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,824
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

358
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,703
- What?
- You didn't knock!

359
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,456
It's habit. I'm sorry.

360
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,167
It's not like you haven't seen it before.
Come on.

361
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,965
This is not funny. You should knock.

362
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:23,633
I'm sorry.

363
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,652
- You look nice.
- Really?

364
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:47,699
This is about the only piece of
my clothing I feel comfortable in.

365
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:49,993
That's mine, actually.

366
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,872
No, it's fine.

367
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,340
What?

368
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,176
You're looking at me like 
I'm some kind of zoo animal.

369
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,014
Sorry, I don't know. I'm just trying 
to figure this out, too, I guess.

370
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,563
You normally do all this?

371
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,024
This is my apology for last night.

372
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:24,194
That was such a bonehead move.
I just wasn't thinking.

373
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,530
No, please. I'm sorry. I...

374
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,200
I don't want you to 
worry about me, okay?

375
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,203
Just go about your normal routine and...

376
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,082
Do you work? Do you have a job?

377
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,378
Yeah. Well, that's if I'm still in business.

378
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,382
I own a recording studio.

379
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:47,676
Cool.

380
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,017
So, what is my routine? 
What do I do all day?

381
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:57,936
Well...

382
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,149
You usually get up and make coffee.

383
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,234
- All right.
- No, no, no. I got it, I got it, I got it.

384
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,736
I did it this morning, I think.

385
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,950
And then you... No, don't. 
That one's for me.

386
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,243
You don't eat meat.

387
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:22,294
Then you check e-mails and pay bills.

388
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,296
Okay.

389
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,591
Which I'm betting that you don't 
remember any of the passwords

390
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,759
or account numbers, huh?

391
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:32,262
- So, I guess I'll do that.
- Okay.

392
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,765
And then you go down to your studio.

393
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:37,934
I could take you down there,
show you what you're working on.

394
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,605
You know what? We don't have 
to rehash everything right now.

395
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,064
I mean, just...

396
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:48,320
You go to work, and we can make
flashcards later, or something.

397
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,908
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

398
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,786
Okay. Well, your, look...

399
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,457
You got keys, phone here.

400
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,336
If you need me, all my 
numbers are on there.

401
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,129
- Okay-
- Okay-

402
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,509
- All right.
- Yup.

403
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,471
Have a good day.

404
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,954
- What's up, Lil?
- Hey.

405
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:40,247
Fill me in.

406
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,624
That guy, Pointy Shoes?
He's a really bad kisser.

407
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:45,752
I don't think I'm gonna 
keep him in rotation.

408
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,003
Okay.

409
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,507
Honestly, though, it's actually been hell.

410
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,801
Yesterday, we were
somehow double-booked.

411
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,303
Too many clients,
that's a high-class problem.

412
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,266
Yeah, but with only one studio,
it's pretty impossible to take on both gigs.

413
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,852
Right? So, Dune Advertising weren't flexible
and they rebooked over at Soundspace.

414
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:06,314
Wait? What? Come on. That's a big account.

415
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,192
They should always be prioritized.

416
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,653
- You know that.
- Yeah. Look...

417
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,783
I can't run the sessions and 
handle account services, right?

418
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,535
This isn't a one-woman operation.

419
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,664
- It's not like I flaked or something.
- I know, I get it. I'm not mad.

420
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:25,166
I'm just... I'm just saying shit's slipping.

421
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,711
Well, I'm here now.

422
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,592
- How's she doing?
- She's getting there.

423
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,595
She's...

424
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,347
Look, thanks.

425
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:41,558
It'll be fine.

426
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,728
Okay. Good.

427
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,733
So, you'll be at the 3:30 pitch?

428
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,234
Of course.

429
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:54,779
I'm going to head home, 
then change, and check on Paige,

430
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:57,073
- but I'll be there.
- Okay.

431
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,756
I vow to help you love life,

432
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,177
to always hold you with tenderness,

433
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,138
and to have the patience 
that love demands.

434
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,432
To speak when words are needed

435
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,352
and to share the silence when they're not.

436
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,730
To agree to disagree on red velvet cake.

437
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:33,943
And to live within the warmth of 
your heart and always call it home.

438
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,404
Did you write your vows on a menu?

439
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:40,533
Weird.

440
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:45,955
I vow to fiercely love you
in all your forms, now and forever.

441
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,668
I promise to never forget
that this is a once-in-a-lifetime love.

442
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,298
And to always know in the 
deepest part of my soul,

443
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:57,967
no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,

444
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:01,805
that we'll always find the 
way back to each other.

445
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,529
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,783
Could I have a...

447
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,035
One of these?

448
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,537
You don't want the usual?

449
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,164
I have a usual?

450
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:31,126
That would be perfect. 
I'll have the usual.

451
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,130
- All right.
- Here you go.

452
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,966
Thank you.

453
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:41,845
Thanks.

454
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,363
Paige?

455
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,972
Can I help you?

456
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,058
Could I borrow your phone?

457
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:31,895
Hello?

458
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,647
Hey, Lil. No, I know it's 3:30.

459
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,734
Look, I can't. I can't. I gotta find Paige.

460
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,986
No, no. I don't know. Make it up.

461
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,074
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

462
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,577
Get in, sweetheart. Get in.

463
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:49,162
Oh, sweetie.

464
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,000
- You all right?
- Yeah.

465
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,012
- Hey.
- Hey.

466
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,933
Where you been?
I was starting to get a little worried.

467
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,601
Thought something
might've happened to you.

468
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:14,270
Sorry. I was lost, physically.

469
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,190
Mentally, I guess, as well.

470
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,025
Well, you should've called me.

471
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,779
Yeah, I forgot the phone and I 
don't know your number by heart,

472
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:27,075
so I called my mom and we made
a day of it, which was great.

473
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,411
She invited us for dinner tonight.

474
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:33,623
Dinner? Okay.

475
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,794
You don't have to go.

476
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:40,547
Well, you're not allowed to drive,
so I do have to go.

477
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,549
But that's not the point.

478
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:50,473
You know, maybe I'm gonna wake up
tomorrow and remember everything,

479
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:53,476
but right now they're the 
only thing I'm sure about.

480
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:58,982
Okay.

481
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,150
We'll go.

482
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,237
Okay.

483
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,324
- Okay.
- Are you gonna change?

484
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:12,996
Changing-

485
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:19,085
It's just a left up here at the Caldwells',
and then a right at the cul-de-sac,

486
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,170
and we're six houses in on the right.

487
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,340
The Prestleys got a new mailbox. So cute.

488
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,595
You know, this arrangement 
doesn't exactly say,

489
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,263
"I'm sorry that we haven't spoken,

490
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,349
"but now that I have a brain injury,
maybe you can overlook it."

491
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,101
You're right.

492
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,854
We should've got them forget-me-nots.

493
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,148
That's funny.

494
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,027
Actually, that is funny.

495
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,280
So, well, you've already met my parents,

496
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:51,117
but my dad will say to call him Bill,
but he prefers Mr. Thornton.

497
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,703
- And my sister's name is...
- Gwen.

498
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,873
I know a lot about your family, Paige.

499
00:40:56,998 --> 00:41:00,043
- Right. Yeah.
- We're married. You know?

500
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,716
- Oh, my God, you're engaged!
- I know.

501
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:12,305
- You guys make a really cute couple.
- Thanks, Paige.

502
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,894
It has been forever.

503
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,313
- Has it?
- Yeah.

504
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:23,733
The weird thing is that everyone 
looks a little bit older.

505
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,818
- Really?
- Yeah. You, especially.

506
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:28,571
I'm... I'm so happy to have you back.

507
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,077
In honor of Paige being home,
I made your favorite dinner.

508
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,079
Filet mignon.

509
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:39,582
Please. Please. Sit down.

510
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,923
Before we start, I think this 
evening deserves a toast.

511
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,174
Darling?

512
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:51,219
Well, I... I would like to drink to my family.

513
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:57,684
I am so fortunate to have these 
three beautiful women in my life

514
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,771
and, when we're all together,
that fortune just multiplies.

515
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,773
Paige, honey, welcome home.

516
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:08,277
To family.

517
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,949
So, Leo, what about your family?

518
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,368
Do you see them often?

519
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,745
- No.
- That's a shame.

520
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,248
Both my parents are dead.

521
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,542
It's just Paige.

522
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,420
She's my family now.

523
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,884
And what kind of work do you do, Leo?

524
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:35,054
I just opened up my own 
recording studio downtown.

525
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,891
Paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business.

526
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:43,104
- I did?
- Yeah.

527
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:48,067
Isn't that sort of a dying field?

528
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:52,989
No, I just mean, can't people record
things on their computers at home

529
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,158
- and they sound just as good?
- Ryan.

530
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,077
- What?
- Look, the records that I like,

531
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,497
they have life and warmth and soul.

532
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,793
Like the slapback on Scotty 
Moore's guitar on Mystery Train.

533
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,755
Look, you're not gonna get
that in your computer.

534
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,257
You're gonna want a live room,
you're gonna want to bounce to tape.

535
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,428
You're gonna want real musicians 
in a room, vibing off of each other.

536
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:16,763
You...

537
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:20,016
I guess, to answer your question,
it may be a dying field

538
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:24,520
and you can record
high-quality stuff at home.

539
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:30,485
But, I mean, come on, you can't get
the Sun Sessions on your laptop.

540
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,710
I heard everyone is 
gonna be here tonight.

541
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,879
This kind of thing might be a 
little too much for Paige.

542
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:52,340
No, I'm good here, actually.

543
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:56,969
Isn't that Diane Chain?

544
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:01,307
Yeah, we don't really 
hang out any more.

545
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,143
God, you have been away a long time.

546
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:05,353
Oh, my God!

547
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:09,732
Good luck, man.

548
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,068
- Hi!
- Hi.

549
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:16,072
Sorry. Leo, these are my 
friends from high school.

550
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:18,157
This is Shana, Carrie, Lizbet.

551
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:19,492
Hi.

552
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,662
What about me? 
I don't get an introduction?

553
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

554
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:34,549
- Sorry, this is...
- Jeremy.

555
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,884
It's been a long time.

556
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,220
Has it?

557
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:43,516
It doesn't seem like it.
You haven't changed a bit.

558
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,185
I'm not sure if she mentioned it. I'm Leo.

559
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,437
- Hi.
- Paige's husband.

560
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:52,358
Right. I'm gonna grab a drink.
You guys want anything?

561
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:54,944
- Disaronno sour?
- I'll have a blueberry mojito.

562
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,195
Really?

563
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:58,030
Yes, I remember.

564
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,704
Oh, my God, Paige. Do you remember
when we were in the ninth grade,

565
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,205
and we were getting ready
for the Christmas dance,

566
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:08,040
we were curling your hair...

567
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,126
We ended up burning off half your hair.

568
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,253
I totally remember that!

569
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:15,214
And didn't I wind up having to 
wear a beret to the dance?

570
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:16,674
No, no, no, that was the...

571
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:24,682
It was like she was some
sweater-set wearing,

572
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:27,101
mojito-drinking sorority girl.

573
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:29,228
Like a Stepford wife?

574
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:33,065
Yeah, basically. She was even flirting
with Jeremy right in front of me.

575
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,818
- Ex-fiancé Jeremy?
- No,no.No.

576
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:38,779
In her mind, it's current fiance Jeremy.

577
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:41,824
Which is why it was 
probably pretty annoying

578
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:45,494
to have her stranger husband
cock-block her all night.

579
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:49,165
That is a lot to get my mind around.

580
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:51,751
So, what turns her on?

581
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:55,504
- Paige?
- No, her mother.

582
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,089
Yes, Paige.

583
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,342
Like, in bed?

584
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:00,843
Oh, my God, Leo.

585
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:02,470
What? It's private. It's...

586
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:05,973
I don't know. It's... It's kind of
a between-me-and-her kind of thing.

587
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:08,184
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

588
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:11,771
She likes being tickled.

589
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,148
Seriously?

590
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:16,400
Thought you weren't gonna judge.

591
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:19,487
I'm not. I'm just... I...
I don't care if you're into kink.

592
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,405
It's not like that.

593
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:23,908
It just breaks her down
when she's stuck in her head.

594
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:26,452
Okay. You should give that a shot.

595
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:29,664
- Seriously?
- Yeah. What do you have to lose?

596
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,557
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hey.

597
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:49,934
Paige?

598
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:53,688
Because I've been dealing with these 
people forever and I know they have...

599
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:59,652
Something importantjust popped up.

600
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,821
I'm gonna call you right back. Okay.

601
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:06,784
- Hi.
- Hi.

602
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,953
Please.

603
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:20,297
So, you remember that time at the lake,

604
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:24,343
when you told me you'd always
have my back, no matter what?

605
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:27,013
- The night in the boathouse.
- Yeah.

606
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:28,472
Yeah.

607
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:32,351
So, can you please tell me
what went down with us?

608
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:37,273
Only you, Paige, can dump a guy,
then come back and demand answers.

609
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:41,360
So I dumped you?

610
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:45,322
A cruel, hard, pre-wedding dumping.

611
00:47:47,158 --> 00:47:48,451
Why?

612
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:52,038
Well, that's a question
that I and all of my friends

613
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:56,042
and the two rebound girls, yeah,
we'd all love an answer to.

614
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:59,378
Come on, seriously.
I must have had some kind of reason.

615
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:00,796
You...

616
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:03,299
You... You changed.

617
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:08,262
You talked differently,
you dressed differently.

618
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:10,931
You weren't sure about 
law school any more.

619
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:15,561
And you definitely weren't sure
about me any more.

620
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:20,399
- Did I give you your ring back?
- Yeah, you did.

621
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:23,986
Who has that now?

622
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,613
No one yet.

623
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:30,493
But I've been with Rose.
You remember? From Gwen's class.

624
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:33,496
I've been with Rose 
for about a year now.

625
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,375
I couldn't wait forever, Paige.

626
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,920
You couldn't have anticipated

627
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:45,299
that I'd have a brain trauma
and forget our break-up

628
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:48,761
and come waltzing into your office
demanding answers?

629
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:50,012
What's wrong with you?

630
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,351
I'm sorry. I'm gonna let 
you go back to work.

631
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:56,852
Sure.

632
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:13,119
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

633
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:14,995
I was not expecting that.

634
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:16,956
Habit, I guess.

635
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:24,755
I honestly didn't even know where
I was headed until I found myself here.

636
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:31,220
It just seems so ridiculous to me
that I shut everyone out for five years.

637
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:37,434
It just doesn't feel right.

638
00:49:51,824 --> 00:49:52,908
Hey.

639
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:56,036
- Hey.
- How was your day?

640
00:49:58,414 --> 00:49:59,874
It was fine.

641
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:04,712
I'm just happy to be home with you.

642
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,175
Sorry about the mess here.

643
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:10,718
No problem.

644
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:14,138
- What, are you collaging?
- Do I collage?

645
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:17,558
No, not that I remember.

646
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:24,023
No, you know, I was just so inspired
just seeing everybody last night.

647
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,566
To collage?

648
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,776
All those memories just 
came flooding back to me,

649
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,572
so I thought I'd make a timeline,
you know, of my life.

650
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:35,242
That's... That's great. 
That's a great idea.

651
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:37,369
Yeah.

652
00:50:37,453 --> 00:50:41,415
I kind of rummaged through some 
of your stuff. I hope you don't mind.

653
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,835
It's fine. It's fine. What's mine is yours.

654
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:47,421
I even have a certificate
from the State of Illinois to prove it.

655
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:49,882
Yes, I found that. It's in the lost years.

656
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,801
See, I started over here.

657
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:56,263
I found some family photos,
me when I was little, stuff like that.

658
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,475
That was easy to put into chronological
order because I remember that stuff.

659
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:02,603
- That's good, right?
- Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

660
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:06,690
But what I've been trying to do
is pinpoint the last memory I had

661
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:09,235
before everything just went blank.

662
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:11,779
How's that going?

663
00:51:12,071 --> 00:51:14,406
I think I was at the Macaroni Grill,

664
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,035
and I was asking them if they had
those special toasted ravioli.

665
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,496
And I don't remember the answer.

666
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:25,376
That's it, that's all, that's my last 
memory before I woke up in a hospital.

667
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:29,922
No. How are we ever gonna know
if they had toasted ravioli?

668
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:37,888
God, this is not happening.

669
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:40,557
- It's okay.
- This is not happening.

670
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:43,644
Okay? No, no, no, no, 
please don't do that.

671
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:49,191
- Come on.
- What...

672
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,485
What are you doing?

673
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:53,779
I'm sorry.

674
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:58,492
I'm sorry. Was that...
That was one of our things?

675
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:00,828
- Yeah, kind of. It...
- I'm sorry...

676
00:52:00,953 --> 00:52:04,290
No. You don't have to say it.
You don't. I get it. It'll all come back.

677
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:06,625
We just have to keep 
doing what we're doing,

678
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:08,377
let you fall back into your life.

679
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,462
It'll all sort itself out.

680
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:13,841
Yeah.

681
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:23,392
About a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up...

682
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:26,478
Glass littered sidewalks,
following two nights of protests

683
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:28,897
-over the police shooting of an...
- Hey.

684
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,649
There were few people on the street.

685
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:32,735
I think I'm ready to see my studio now.

686
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:35,487
- Will you show it to me?
- Yeah.

687
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:36,989
Come on.

688
00:52:56,175 --> 00:52:59,678
This is the first studio
you've ever had to yourself.

689
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:03,432
It's a cool space, huh?

690
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,857
You weren't sure you 
liked it at first, though.

691
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,110
Until you had this idea
to burn some smudge stick

692
00:53:15,194 --> 00:53:18,614
that you bought from some 
guy on the corner of Diversey.

693
00:53:20,032 --> 00:53:22,034
We lit this thing and we 
started waving it around

694
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:26,080
until we realized that it was 
just some old pieces of lettuce.

695
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:30,584
So, we're waving around 
burning lettuce. I don't know.

696
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,879
But it must've done the trick, though,

697
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:37,299
'cause after that,
I couldn't get you out of here.

698
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:43,806
You would come in and crank your music,
and you'd get lost in a project,

699
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:46,975
and I'd have to come and 
remind you that it was nighttime.

700
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:53,732
This is one of your pieces
for the Tribune Tower series.

701
00:53:53,816 --> 00:53:55,943
What is it supposed to be?

702
00:53:56,777 --> 00:53:59,321
I'm not sure if you even knew yet.

703
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,617
But come here.

704
00:54:04,118 --> 00:54:05,494
I...

705
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:10,958
Here, just help it figure out
what it wants to be.

706
00:54:16,088 --> 00:54:17,464
Okay.

707
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:21,009
I don't...
I don't really know how to use this thing.

708
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:23,512
Sure you do. Wait, hold on.

709
00:54:30,686 --> 00:54:32,771
That's better. Come on.

710
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:34,606
Just try it. It might be fun.

711
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,109
Can you just turn 
down the music, please?

712
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:40,195
I swear you used to listen to it
so much louder than this.

713
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,614
I never could understand how 
you would just be able to focus...

714
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:47,286
I have a clinically bad, goddamn headache!
Please turn down the music!

715
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,212
I'm trying to help you!

716
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:03,051
But I am not your punching bag.

717
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:07,848
We don't speak to each other like this.

718
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:14,563
This is hard for me, too, Paige.

719
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:00,526
Paige?

720
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:02,069
Yeah?

721
00:56:03,946 --> 00:56:05,113
- Hey.
- Hey.

722
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:08,784
I passed by that little Portuguese bakery
that you love on the way home,

723
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:10,702
and I got us some...

724
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:16,542
- ls somebody here?
- Yeah.

725
00:56:20,963 --> 00:56:22,923
- Leo.
- Hey.

726
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:27,302
My sister's just up to her 
eyeballs with this wedding stuff,

727
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:29,221
and we've got the 
engagement party coming up.

728
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:32,724
And we all thought Paige could 
come home and help her out.

729
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:36,895
It just seems like the right thing 
to do, to be there for Gwen.

730
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:42,401
Okay. But what about your life here?

731
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:47,239
What about all the work
that you haven't finished?

732
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:49,324
I talked to the people at the Tribune.

733
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,660
And they were really understanding
about the accident,

734
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:55,747
and Dad's gonna loan me the money
to pay back their advance, so...

735
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:58,333
I don't know. I just... I can't do it.

736
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:00,919
You just come out when 
you're ready, honey.

737
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:02,754
Okay, thanks, Dad.

738
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,637
I'm sorry. It's just until after the wedding.

739
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:13,432
I just want you to be careful, okay?

740
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:17,686
Well, I'm not joining a cult.
I'm just going to stay with my family.

741
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:19,688
- I know, but...
- But what?

742
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:28,280
Can I at least give you an awkward hug?

743
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,801
- So, how are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

744
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:53,055
Yeah? No dizziness,
disorientation, sleepiness?

745
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:54,973
- Nope.
- Great.

746
00:57:55,057 --> 00:57:58,018
Well, I'm very happy,
and your CT scan looks excellent.

747
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:00,729
What a relief. Well...

748
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:03,732
So, your memory recall, anything?

749
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:06,401
- Not really.
- No, huh?

750
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,403
That's not normal, is it?

751
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:10,572
Listen, when it comes to the brain,
nothing is normal,

752
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:12,824
because no two brain 
injuries are the same.

753
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:15,744
Paige seems perfectly herself again.

754
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,412
It's wonderful.

755
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:20,248
Mrs. Thornton, could I just talk to 
Paige alone for a moment, please?

756
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,920
It's okay, Mom. I'm... I'm good.

757
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,216
All right.

758
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,094
Thanks.

759
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:42,354
Paige, do you want to 
regain your memory?

760
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:43,605
Yes.

761
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:46,191
Because some patients fear
that when their memory comes back,

762
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:49,111
so will the memory of the trauma,
but mercifully that's rarely the case.

763
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:51,363
Oh, no, that's not it. I'm... I'm...

764
00:58:51,446 --> 00:58:53,407
I'm not afraid of the accident.

765
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:55,701
So, what are you afraid of?

766
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:02,874
I guess I just... I don't know. It's...

767
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:07,045
I mean, what if I don't 
like the life that I had?

768
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:08,714
Or what if I like it too much?

769
00:59:08,797 --> 00:59:10,048
I...

770
00:59:10,132 --> 00:59:12,050
I just don't know.

771
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:16,471
I only did one psych rotation,
so this may be terrible advice.

772
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:20,559
But I think you have 
to try and fill the holes.

773
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:23,812
You can still decide 
you want a different life,

774
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:27,399
but if you don't at least
open yourself up to remembering,

775
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:31,069
I'm afraid you're gonna live 
in fear of your own past.

776
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:35,490
Hey. I'm here.

777
00:59:37,993 --> 00:59:39,411
These guys are?

778
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,247
Knife Skillz, With a Z.

779
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,623
Right.

780
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:47,836
Okay, Mikey, sounds amazing.
Let's just go for it.

781
00:59:49,004 --> 00:59:50,505
I am going for it.

782
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:52,007
The bass line is one note.

783
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:54,468
- Just one note.
- Okay, cool.

784
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:56,344
Take two.

785
01:00:01,183 --> 01:00:02,934
You look different.

786
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:06,021
Yeah. Going for a Kanye kind of thing.

787
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:09,357
I'm gonna say more Michael Bublé,
but, whatever, it's still good.

788
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:15,864
So... I'm gonna be in 
and out for a while.

789
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:21,036
Sounds really good, Mikey.

790
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,873
Let's just take it from the top
or the middle or wherever.

791
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:29,878
You know what? People come 
here to work with you, okay?

792
01:00:30,003 --> 01:00:32,881
I mean, I'm doing my best,
but you gotta be here.

793
01:00:33,006 --> 01:00:34,341
I know.

794
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:37,803
But if Paige is in Lake 
Forest with her family,

795
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:39,554
that's where I gotta be.

796
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:42,390
I gotta make my wife
fall in love with me again.

797
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:55,821
- You found each other.
- Hi!

798
01:00:55,904 --> 01:00:57,739
- Hi.
- Let's see it.

799
01:00:57,823 --> 01:01:00,575
It's good to see you. 
All right, take it easy.

800
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,577
- The countdown's on, man.
- Hey, man.

801
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:05,580
One week left of your former life.
How you feeling?

802
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,499
I feel pretty good, actually.

803
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:10,752
I mean, I do get a little dizzy
if I think about it for too long, but...

804
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:11,920
What?

805
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:16,174
No, honey, it's like a good dizzy. It's like...

806
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:19,427
It's like panic or excitement.

807
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:24,349
Well, panic and excitement are different.

808
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:27,269
- Honey, there's gonna be 400 people there.
- Right.

809
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:30,856
Hey, do you also have
a little tingling in your fingers?

810
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:33,567
Yeah. Is that bad?

811
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:36,027
Do you listen to Radiohead?

812
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:39,739
Thom Yorke,
he talks about dizzy spells all the time.

813
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,242
He says when his fingers tingle,

814
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:45,829
that's how he knows
that he's creating something genius.

815
01:01:45,954 --> 01:01:49,499
And then he gets so amped up 
playing that he almost passes out.

816
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:53,169
Ryan, it sounds to me like 
you're on the verge of genius.

817
01:01:53,295 --> 01:01:55,380
- That's cool, man.
- Cheers.

818
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:57,841
Ryan, I have someone 
I want you to meet.

819
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,844
- Mom, you listen to Radiohead?
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

820
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:02,971
So, is that true?

821
01:02:11,605 --> 01:02:12,647
Paige?

822
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,317
Hey, Leo.

823
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:20,906
- What?
- Your hair.

824
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,490
It looks so different.

825
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,827
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

826
01:02:26,494 --> 01:02:28,830
Okay, look, so I've been 
thinking about something.

827
01:02:28,955 --> 01:02:31,625
- Okay.
- What's your favorite book?

828
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,755
- It's probably not what you remember.
- That's fine. That's not the point.

829
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:39,299
Okay. The Beach House by James Patterson.

830
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:41,509
- No, really?
- Yeah.

831
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:44,179
Okay. The Beach House.

832
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:48,099
Okay, if it was great, you probably 
loaned it to somebody, right?

833
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:50,226
Yeah. Gwen, I think.

834
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:52,979
Okay, and you probably said to yourself,

835
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:55,482
God, I wish I was the person
that hadn't read it,

836
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,984
"so that I could experience it all over again."

837
01:02:58,068 --> 01:02:59,986
Yeah, I guess so.

838
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,030
That's how I think we should look at this.

839
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:05,408
What?

840
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,371
You can't remember how we met.

841
01:03:09,746 --> 01:03:12,040
And you can't remember 
how we fell in love.

842
01:03:12,165 --> 01:03:14,793
And in a way, yeah, that sucks.

843
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:19,047
But it was the greatest time of my life.

844
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:23,593
I just thought how cool it would be
to get to experience it all over again.

845
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:27,180
Like reading your favorite book
for the first time.

846
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:29,057
- Exactly.
- Got you.

847
01:03:29,516 --> 01:03:31,726
Which is why I want to 
ask you out on a date.

848
01:03:34,229 --> 01:03:35,605
A date?

849
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,941
Like two people that are just 
meeting for the first time.

850
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:40,193
Jeremy...

851
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:42,988
Yeah, I'm sorry.

852
01:03:43,071 --> 01:03:47,784
Well, I don't know. I mean, you know,
we've got the wedding coming up.

853
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,536
But if we go out before then,

854
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,955
you might still be able
to take me as your date.

855
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,126
I can't promise anything,
but I'll put in a good word for you.

856
01:03:57,794 --> 01:03:59,254
All right.

857
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:00,797
- Yeah?
- A date.

858
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:14,019
So, I have an idea, but it 
involves going into the city.

859
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:16,855
- You okay with that?
- Yeah, that's fine.

860
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:19,441
I just have to be back
by 10:00 in the morning.

861
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:21,776
- Oh, my God.
- What?

862
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:24,738
First date and you're already
inviting yourself to stay the night?

863
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:26,948
I'm just a little scandalized is all.

864
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:30,535
- No, I just meant...
- Don't worry. I'll have you back tonight.

865
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:35,081
If you wanna stay the night, that's...
I mean, it's... If you want...

866
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:38,293
You wanna just see how it goes? All right.

867
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:58,313
Should we get out?

868
01:04:58,438 --> 01:05:00,315
We don't have to.

869
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:02,233
Is this the part of the 
date where I find out

870
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:05,361
you're not actually my husband
but some crazy stalker,

871
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:07,530
and you're gonna strangle me
with my purse?

872
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:12,285
No. This is the exact parking spot
where we first met.

873
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:18,124
I'm gonna take you on
a little retrospective of us.

874
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:29,511
That is so good.

875
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:31,930
You ready for dessert?

876
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:33,640
Dessert?

877
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,227
- We just had waffles.
- This is dinner.

878
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:40,980
These are dessert.

879
01:05:43,191 --> 01:05:45,985
Well, how do you know
what flavors they all are?

880
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:49,781
It's like a chocolate Russian roulette.
It's part of the fun.

881
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:52,867
We'd be surprised by the ones 
we liked and the ones we didn't.

882
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:54,160
Okay.

883
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:57,372
And...

884
01:05:58,706 --> 01:06:01,376
- You don't like it?
- I do not like that one.

885
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:04,337
Here. Try this one. 
I think you'd like this one.

886
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:13,429
- Told you.
- Okay.

887
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:16,724
Your turn.

888
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,896
Are we going shot for shot?

889
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:30,029
Wait till you try their hot chocolate.

890
01:06:30,113 --> 01:06:32,157
We would come here 
whenever it snowed.

891
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,242
Are you trying to make me diabetic
or just fat?

892
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,702
No, I...

893
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:43,209
You got a... It's still in your hair.

894
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:59,267
So, we come down here at night
and look at the lake?

895
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,312
That's not exactly what we do.

896
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,818
I... I'm not...

897
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:12,113
- I don't...
- No, no, it's not that.

898
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:15,909
We said we'd go in once a month every
month, and we haven't done April yet.

899
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:18,786
We started in July.

900
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:24,375
Why? Why would we do that?

901
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:28,338
We were at this spaghetti place, and 
we had this waiter and he said he did it.

902
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:30,798
And he was, like, 80.
So we thought we could.

903
01:07:30,924 --> 01:07:32,342
Yeah.

904
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:35,261
- Now, we said no wetsuits, but...
- You're serious.

905
01:07:35,345 --> 01:07:37,847
...for you, I guess I'll make an exception.

906
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:47,607
All right. Turn around.

907
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,652
Turn around.

908
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:02,455
Okay.

909
01:08:03,873 --> 01:08:06,459
- Wait. No wetsuit?
- We said no wetsuits, right?

910
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,173
Yeah.

911
01:08:16,344 --> 01:08:17,762
Oh, no.

912
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:19,472
No,no.No,no!

913
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:34,570
Come on.

914
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:46,874
Thank you.

915
01:08:50,545 --> 01:08:53,673
- Heat, heat.
- My left eyelid's frozen shut.

916
01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:01,556
I can't feel my fingers.

917
01:09:04,017 --> 01:09:05,184
I can't feel them.

918
01:09:17,947 --> 01:09:20,158
I don't know what your 
Paige did on a first date,

919
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:24,537
but with me, you're 
only getting to first base.

920
01:09:26,414 --> 01:09:27,623
Okay.

921
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,591
I'm sorry. I can do better.
My... My lips are still numb.

922
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:41,429
It's nice.

923
01:09:50,313 --> 01:09:52,106
Second base, tops.

924
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:55,276
This is perfect.

925
01:10:16,506 --> 01:10:19,133
Thank you for coming 
out with me tonight.

926
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:21,469
I had a really nice time.

927
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,849
I've missed you.

928
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:30,603
I miss our life together.
I miss being with you.

929
01:10:35,108 --> 01:10:36,526
I love you.

930
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:47,286
I should probably get inside.

931
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:53,334
Good night.

932
01:11:12,562 --> 01:11:13,896
Hey.

933
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:17,859
Hey. I didn't know you 
were gonna be here.

934
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:20,111
Were you out with Jeremy?

935
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:21,446
No.

936
01:11:21,863 --> 01:11:23,614
I was with Leo.

937
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:26,701
I like him.

938
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:30,580
Yeah.

939
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:33,458
Me, too.

940
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:36,752
Are you okay?

941
01:11:41,966 --> 01:11:45,219
Paige, I've never seen you like this before.

942
01:11:45,303 --> 01:11:47,722
I mean, is this crying thing the new you?

943
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:49,682
Because it's bizarre.

944
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:53,394
I don't know. I don't know what's me.
I have a tattoo.

945
01:11:56,606 --> 01:11:58,816
And I'm a vegetarian, too.

946
01:12:00,568 --> 01:12:03,905
Look, it was just like it used to be.
It was better, actually.

947
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:08,826
Everything that I fell in love with
about Paige is still there.

948
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,748
You know, to you, I'm sure it seemed
like a confirmation of your love

949
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:15,583
or your marriage, right?

950
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:18,461
But to her, it probably seemed 
more like a really good first date.

951
01:12:18,586 --> 01:12:20,505
Exactly. Which is why
I think you've gotta wait

952
01:12:20,588 --> 01:12:22,131
the requisite three days before you call.

953
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:25,927
I gotta wait three days to call
after a date with my own wife?

954
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,554
At least. This is a unique case. Maybe longer.

955
01:12:28,638 --> 01:12:30,973
It can't be longer. I'm gonna see
her on Saturday at the wedding.

956
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,892
I'm telling you, it was so obvious.

957
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:35,937
Even with all this crazy shit going 
on around us, we still belong together.

958
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,981
- Obvious to her or to you?
- To both of us.

959
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:42,026
- Paige?
- Yeah?

960
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:45,071
We have to start writing out
those place cards after we eat.

961
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:46,489
Yes.

962
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:49,116
Before you start on that,

963
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:53,788
I have a little surprise for you, Paige.

964
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:57,416
You know Ray Porter, right?

965
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,169
He taught constitutional 
law at Northwestern.

966
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:04,298
He and I were on law review together.
We've known each other 1,000 years.

967
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:07,260
He is the dean of the law school now.

968
01:13:07,343 --> 01:13:10,221
- Okay.
- And they're gonna let you back in.

969
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:11,889
What?

970
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:13,474
Well...

971
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:16,227
I didn't even apply.

972
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:17,979
I took care of it.

973
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:23,192
This is crazy.

974
01:13:25,236 --> 01:13:28,489
I feel like I'm getting a 
free do-over in life.

975
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:01,957
You look like you could use a drink.

976
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,877
I've already had several.

977
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,088
But you haven't had this.

978
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,758
All right.

979
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,762
I'm glad we're having a moment alone.

980
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:18,349
I haven't gotten a chance
to really talk to you, Leo.

981
01:15:18,516 --> 01:15:19,809
Yeah.

982
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:21,602
Yeah, cool.

983
01:15:22,603 --> 01:15:24,271
Congratulations.

984
01:15:28,776 --> 01:15:31,112
- That's nice.
- Yes, it is.

985
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:35,741
I've been thinking.

986
01:15:35,825 --> 01:15:40,996
And I think that it's probably time
to let us take it from here.

987
01:15:41,122 --> 01:15:42,373
Take what?

988
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,792
Things with Paige.

989
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,170
Look, I know she didn't have
health insurance because

990
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:51,298
you chose to live in a certain way,

991
01:15:52,466 --> 01:15:54,301
and I know you must 
be drowning in debt.

992
01:15:55,386 --> 01:15:57,972
But I also know a way out of this.

993
01:15:58,681 --> 01:16:00,182
What's that?

994
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:02,810
Divorce her.

995
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:06,313
The bills have only just begun, Leo.

996
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:12,445
Mr. Thornton, I don't think this is 
the time or the place to discuss this.

997
01:16:12,528 --> 01:16:15,531
Fine. If you don't care
about losing your business,

998
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:19,577
which, clearly, you don't, 
what about Paige?

999
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,621
What about doing what is
obviously the right thing for her?

1000
01:16:22,705 --> 01:16:24,999
- And you know what's right for her?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

1001
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:28,461
- You're such a hypocrite.
- What did you say?

1002
01:16:28,544 --> 01:16:31,505
If you're such a family 
man, how come I...

1003
01:16:31,589 --> 01:16:35,009
I never once saw you come and try
to put things back together with Paige?

1004
01:16:39,847 --> 01:16:41,682
You're such a coward.

1005
01:16:57,865 --> 01:17:00,034
Hey, can I introduce you around a little bit?

1006
01:17:00,743 --> 01:17:04,205
- Can't feel good to be the odd man out.
- I'm not the odd man out.

1007
01:17:04,455 --> 01:17:07,958
All right. If you say so. You just seem
a little creepy over here all by yourself.

1008
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:10,044
I'm just waiting for Paige, man.

1009
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:12,296
All right, well, best of luck with that.

1010
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,881
You like this, right?

1011
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:18,093
- I'm sorry, like what?
- Paige leaves you behind.

1012
01:17:18,219 --> 01:17:21,889
She goes and has this life without you,
with some guy that no one gets.

1013
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:23,557
And now you get to 
see her reject all that.

1014
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:26,769
I mean, I like it a little bit.

1015
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:28,270
Yeah?

1016
01:17:28,395 --> 01:17:30,356
Well, let me tell you what I like.

1017
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:33,150
I like the fact that Paige told me
everything about you, Jeremy.

1018
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:35,236
Okay.

1019
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:38,447
She told me that when she was with you,

1020
01:17:39,657 --> 01:17:43,327
she would wake up at night in a panic,
thinking, "Is this all there is?"

1021
01:17:45,287 --> 01:17:47,665
She told you everything, huh?

1022
01:17:47,832 --> 01:17:50,334
Did she tell you that she threw 
herself at me the other day?

1023
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:52,294
Did she tell you that?

1024
01:17:52,419 --> 01:17:56,090
Or did she stop telling you everything
when she forgot who the hell you were?

1025
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,427
Look, I get why you're being such a dick.

1026
01:18:01,095 --> 01:18:03,931
You obviously love her, and you 
think you're gonna get her back.

1027
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:07,268
But the thing is, she outgrew you.

1028
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:10,104
What makes you think
that won't happen again?

1029
01:18:10,646 --> 01:18:12,606
Thank you for that advice.

1030
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,276
I will mull it over while I'm 
in bed with your wife.

1031
01:18:16,986 --> 01:18:18,195
Leo!

1032
01:18:30,332 --> 01:18:32,585
- Paige, wait!
- What the hell were you thinking?

1033
01:18:32,668 --> 01:18:36,839
I don't know. That's a really good question,
because I have been driving myself insane,

1034
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:39,216
making a complete ass of myself!

1035
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,177
Literally trying everything possible
to try to save what we have.

1036
01:18:42,303 --> 01:18:44,305
And you've been
throwing yourself at Jeremy.

1037
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:47,516
- That's not fair.
- It's not fair?

1038
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,979
I see the way you look at him.

1039
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:55,065
I know,

1040
01:18:56,317 --> 01:18:59,153
because you used to 
look at me that way.

1041
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:04,950
- Leo, I...
- No, I think we need to start being realistic.

1042
01:19:05,034 --> 01:19:06,827
Your memory's not coming back.

1043
01:19:07,912 --> 01:19:10,581
The fact is that I'm still just a stranger.

1044
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:14,668
I'm not trying to hurt you.

1045
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:18,505
But I'm just...

1046
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:24,845
I'm so tired of disappointing you.

1047
01:19:26,889 --> 01:19:28,182
I know.

1048
01:19:29,892 --> 01:19:31,518
I'm so sorry.

1049
01:19:35,064 --> 01:19:37,441
I'll apologize to Gwen and Ryan.

1050
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:40,277
Oh, God, no, it's fine.

1051
01:19:41,737 --> 01:19:45,574
Wedding disasters have a way
of turning into great stories.

1052
01:19:47,368 --> 01:19:48,869
Eventually.

1053
01:19:56,085 --> 01:20:00,547
How do you look at the girl you love
and tell yourself it's time to walk away?

1054
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:11,475
Leo?

1055
01:20:16,105 --> 01:20:19,733
I hope one day I can love
the way that you love me.

1056
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,114
You figured it out once.

1057
01:20:26,573 --> 01:20:28,575
You'll do it again.

1058
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:45,527
Shit.

1059
01:21:45,861 --> 01:21:47,988
You're here, not there.

1060
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,324
Are you okay?

1061
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:51,700
I'm done.

1062
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,495
It's over. I give up.

1063
01:21:55,162 --> 01:21:56,830
No, you never give up, Leo.

1064
01:21:56,914 --> 01:22:00,751
No, if we were meant to be 
together, we would be together.

1065
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:06,799
I was just thinking about the first time
that we went to that Greek restaurant

1066
01:22:06,882 --> 01:22:08,383
on the corner.

1067
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:11,929
There was this big banner saying
"Now Serving Soup,"

1068
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:18,435
and I just started to go on and on
about all the obstacles

1069
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:20,145
that the owner must have overcome

1070
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:22,689
to achieve his lifelong 
dream of serving soup.

1071
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:27,027
And then... And when I was finished...

1072
01:22:28,195 --> 01:22:32,074
She didn't say anything for
a few seconds and she just...

1073
01:22:34,243 --> 01:22:36,453
She just sort of exhaled it.

1074
01:22:38,247 --> 01:22:40,374
It was almost to herself.

1075
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,460
"I love you."

1076
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:47,214
And it just hung there.

1077
01:22:48,382 --> 01:22:52,261
It was the first time she had said it,
and I didn't even wanna respond.

1078
01:22:52,386 --> 01:22:54,888
I just wanted to keep hearing it.

1079
01:22:57,391 --> 01:22:59,935
That was two weeks after we met.

1080
01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:05,899
It only took her two weeks
to fall in love with me before.

1081
01:23:16,952 --> 01:23:18,745
She doesn't love me.

1082
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:12,633
Sign here, please.

1083
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:51,171
Come here, little buddy.

1084
01:25:00,013 --> 01:25:01,181
Diane?

1085
01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:03,350
Hey.

1086
01:25:04,059 --> 01:25:06,228
- How are you?
- Listen...

1087
01:25:08,855 --> 01:25:11,108
I know it's been years.

1088
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:13,694
I was away for a while.

1089
01:25:14,361 --> 01:25:17,114
I never had a chance to apologize.

1090
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:20,867
I was just going through
a really weird time,

1091
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:23,870
but your dad ended it

1092
01:25:25,414 --> 01:25:28,000
as soon as your mother
confronted him about us.

1093
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:31,044
And I just always wanted 
you to know that.

1094
01:25:31,545 --> 01:25:34,089
I don't mean to open old wounds, but...

1095
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:37,968
I just really needed 
to say that I'm sorry.

1096
01:25:39,553 --> 01:25:42,139
No, I'm really glad that 
you said something.

1097
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:44,933
You were always a really good friend.

1098
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,728
I just wish I could've returned the favor.

1099
01:25:48,103 --> 01:25:51,773
The lilies were bad,
so I got sunflowers instead.

1100
01:26:02,576 --> 01:26:04,995
- I wanted to tell you.
- You knew?

1101
01:26:06,288 --> 01:26:08,248
You knew the whole time?

1102
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,585
- I'm sorry.
- Don't talk to me.

1103
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:14,629
Paige. Paige. Paige!

1104
01:26:18,175 --> 01:26:20,427
Hey, where have you 
been all day, stranger?

1105
01:26:22,763 --> 01:26:23,972
Paige?

1106
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:27,809
I ran into Diane Chain at the store.

1107
01:26:30,437 --> 01:26:33,857
That's why I left, isn't it?
Because I found out.

1108
01:26:35,859 --> 01:26:39,196
Mom, I barely even know who I am,

1109
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:41,656
and then it turns out you're lying to me,

1110
01:26:41,782 --> 01:26:45,202
and you've used my accident
to rewrite the past?

1111
01:26:47,204 --> 01:26:49,831
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you again.

1112
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:54,419
Do you have any idea how 
betrayed I feel right now?

1113
01:26:54,503 --> 01:26:56,505
I'm sorry, Paige.

1114
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:58,840
We were happier than 
we'd been in years.

1115
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:01,802
- Mom!
- We finally had you back again.

1116
01:27:01,885 --> 01:27:04,388
- Back on your terms!
- No!

1117
01:27:04,471 --> 01:27:06,640
- Yes, as usual!
- Paige!

1118
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:09,851
He cheated on you with my friend!

1119
01:27:11,019 --> 01:27:13,313
How could you stay with him?

1120
01:27:14,648 --> 01:27:15,816
I...

1121
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,487
I was going to leave.

1122
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:24,825
I was. I was all ready to leave.

1123
01:27:25,492 --> 01:27:29,830
And then one afternoon,
I was all alone in the house,

1124
01:27:30,831 --> 01:27:35,377
and I started looking at
all the photographs of you

1125
01:27:36,086 --> 01:27:37,712
and your...

1126
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,675
And your sister.

1127
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:46,847
And the house seemed 
so full of all of us.

1128
01:27:49,057 --> 01:27:51,268
We were a family, Paige.

1129
01:27:52,853 --> 01:27:55,522
And I realized in that moment that

1130
01:27:56,231 --> 01:27:59,860
that was the most important 
thing in the world for me.

1131
01:28:00,277 --> 01:28:03,113
And I couldn't, I couldn't,

1132
01:28:03,864 --> 01:28:06,408
I could not go.

1133
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:11,079
So, you just wasped it away?

1134
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:12,706
No.

1135
01:28:13,623 --> 01:28:17,043
I chose to stay with him

1136
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:21,381
for all the things that he had done right

1137
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:27,053
and not to leave him for the
one thing that he had done wrong.

1138
01:28:30,557 --> 01:28:32,559
I chose to forgive him.

1139
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,317
Maybe Leo was right.

1140
01:28:41,485 --> 01:28:46,072
Maybe I can't figure out who 
I am and be around all of you.

1141
01:29:00,795 --> 01:29:02,923
I still feel a little chilly.
I don't care what you say.

1142
01:29:04,508 --> 01:29:05,967
That's fine.

1143
01:29:08,345 --> 01:29:09,429
Paige.

1144
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:19,773
- I'm sorry.
- ls everything okay?

1145
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:26,196
Look, you two obviously 
need to talk, so I'm just...

1146
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,781
- Okay.
- Talk to you later.

1147
01:29:27,864 --> 01:29:29,491
All right, bye.

1148
01:29:32,118 --> 01:29:33,870
I'm... I'm sorry.

1149
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,457
What happened?

1150
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:42,546
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

1151
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:45,966
You can always ask me anything.

1152
01:29:46,633 --> 01:29:49,302
Did you know about my dad's affair?

1153
01:29:50,637 --> 01:29:51,805
Yeah.

1154
01:29:52,472 --> 01:29:53,807
I knew.

1155
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:01,815
Why didn't you tell me?

1156
01:30:09,072 --> 01:30:12,534
There were so many 
times that I almost did.

1157
01:30:15,203 --> 01:30:18,331
But to drive you away
from your family again?

1158
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,667
That just felt wrong.

1159
01:30:22,752 --> 01:30:24,629
I wanted your love, I...

1160
01:30:24,713 --> 01:30:26,548
Just not like that.

1161
01:30:27,841 --> 01:30:29,676
I wanted to earn it.

1162
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:49,195
I just don't think I can afford
to lose them right now.

1163
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,450
So don't.

1164
01:31:01,458 --> 01:31:04,836
Certain parties have sought
to nullify various congressional acts,

1165
01:31:04,919 --> 01:31:07,756
claiming that repeated extensions
of copyright protection

1166
01:31:07,881 --> 01:31:09,966
constitute a perpetual copyright

1167
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:14,054
of the sort the drafters of the 
Constitution would have rejected.

1168
01:31:14,137 --> 01:31:18,892
The United States Supreme Court,
in the 2003 case of Eldred v. Ashcroft...

1169
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:27,942
Thanks for lunch.

1170
01:31:28,068 --> 01:31:31,613
Actually, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

1171
01:31:31,738 --> 01:31:32,906
Okay.

1172
01:31:33,782 --> 01:31:36,242
Things are over with Rose.

1173
01:31:37,452 --> 01:31:39,245
I ended it, Paige.

1174
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,832
No. Why did you do that?

1175
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:44,709
I thought you were getting engaged...

1176
01:31:44,793 --> 01:31:46,378
We were, but that was before you.

1177
01:31:46,461 --> 01:31:47,921
No, that was after me.

1178
01:31:48,004 --> 01:31:50,173
Okay, it was after you,
but it was before this you.

1179
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,133
It was before the old you came back.

1180
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:56,304
Jeremy, I'm not the old me.

1181
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,015
I'm just me.

1182
01:31:59,474 --> 01:32:02,686
I'm just the me that's 
trying to figure it out still.

1183
01:32:03,103 --> 01:32:07,941
I understand, but, whichever it is,
the old you or the new you, I don't care.

1184
01:32:09,609 --> 01:32:12,070
I know you remember what we 
were like together. I know you do.

1185
01:32:12,153 --> 01:32:15,281
- This is our chance to get that back.
- What we had was wonderful.

1186
01:32:15,365 --> 01:32:17,909
Those were wonderful memories,
but those were...

1187
01:32:17,992 --> 01:32:20,078
Those are my only memories.

1188
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:22,539
Everything after you is erased.

1189
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:24,666
I...

1190
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:31,715
I have to discover what it's like
to be without you, on my own.

1191
01:32:34,217 --> 01:32:37,137
Are you sure you don't remember
breaking up with me the first time?

1192
01:32:37,971 --> 01:32:39,389
Why?

1193
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:41,808
'Cause it sounded a 
hell of a lot like that.

1194
01:32:46,062 --> 01:32:47,480
Let's go.

1195
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:00,952
Hey. I was looking all over.

1196
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:04,914
I was worried when I didn't 
see you outside the library.

1197
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,752
So...

1198
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:14,758
How's that intellectual 
property class going?

1199
01:33:20,346 --> 01:33:23,224
Actually, I wanna talk to you about that.

1200
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:26,895
I've decided to leave law school.

1201
01:33:28,855 --> 01:33:31,024
And I'm gonna get an 
apartment in the city.

1202
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,402
It's happening all over again, isn't it?

1203
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:36,196
Damn it, Paige.

1204
01:33:37,697 --> 01:33:39,240
I've made a lot of mistakes.

1205
01:33:40,033 --> 01:33:44,245
Dad, this isn't about you
or anything you've done.

1206
01:33:44,871 --> 01:33:49,125
This is about me, 
who I want to be, who I am.

1207
01:33:50,376 --> 01:33:55,048
Just tell me what to say,
so I don't lose you again.

1208
01:33:58,384 --> 01:33:59,969
You won't.

1209
01:34:08,061 --> 01:34:10,230
A moment of impact.

1210
01:34:16,277 --> 01:34:20,573
A moment of impact
whose potential for change

1211
01:34:20,657 --> 01:34:24,118
has ripple effects far beyond 
what we can predict,

1212
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,250
sending some particles 
crashing together

1213
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,754
making them closer than before,

1214
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:44,514
while sending others spinning 
off into great ventures

1215
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:50,687
landing where you never 
thought you'd find them.

1216
01:34:54,274 --> 01:34:57,652
You see, that's the thing
about moments like these.

1217
01:34:58,528 --> 01:35:00,196
You can't,

1218
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:03,283
no matter how hard you try,

1219
01:35:04,033 --> 01:35:06,786
control how they're gonna affect you.

1220
01:35:08,621 --> 01:35:12,292
You just gotta let the colliding 
particles land where they may

1221
01:35:13,293 --> 01:35:17,380
and wait until the next collision.

1222
01:35:25,305 --> 01:35:28,266
I vow to help you love life,

1223
01:35:28,349 --> 01:35:30,727
to always hold you with tenderness,

1224
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:33,688
and to have the patience 
that love demands.

1225
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:35,899
To speak when words are needed

1226
01:35:35,982 --> 01:35:38,651
and to share the silence when they're not.

1227
01:35:38,735 --> 01:35:42,322
To agree to disagree on red velvet cake.

1228
01:35:42,989 --> 01:35:47,368
And to live within the warmth of 
your heart and always call it home.

1229
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:34,374
Hi.

1230
01:36:37,377 --> 01:36:38,753
Hi.

1231
01:36:42,215 --> 01:36:45,426
I hope you didn't come all the way
into the city for hot chocolate.

1232
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:49,222
Actually, I moved back
here six months ago.

1233
01:36:49,305 --> 01:36:51,391
I'm over in Rogers Park.

1234
01:36:52,225 --> 01:36:55,228
Really? That... That's great.

1235
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:57,730
I'm actually back at the Art Institute.

1236
01:36:57,814 --> 01:36:59,399
What? Are you kidding me?

1237
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,859
That's amazing.

1238
01:37:01,943 --> 01:37:04,904
Yeah. I mean, I'm sitting 
in on a few classes,

1239
01:37:05,947 --> 01:37:09,325
and it's crazy what my hands remember

1240
01:37:09,409 --> 01:37:12,412
that my, you know, that my mind forgot.

1241
01:37:13,496 --> 01:37:14,831
Yeah.

1242
01:37:16,249 --> 01:37:17,959
So, thank you.

1243
01:37:19,627 --> 01:37:21,087
I didn't do anything.

1244
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:23,006
You did everything.

1245
01:37:24,424 --> 01:37:27,677
You accepted me for who I am,

1246
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:31,264
and not for what you wanted me to be.

1247
01:37:34,934 --> 01:37:37,270
I just wanted you to be happy.

1248
01:37:39,272 --> 01:37:40,773
That's all.

1249
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:51,325
Isn't there some Cuban 
place around here

1250
01:37:51,451 --> 01:37:55,288
where we used to go
when this place was closed?

1251
01:37:56,998 --> 01:38:00,001
Yeah. It's... Wait. You remember?

1252
01:38:00,877 --> 01:38:02,045
No, no.

1253
01:38:03,504 --> 01:38:04,839
I wish.

1254
01:38:05,298 --> 01:38:09,302
No, the memory stuff
hasn't come back, but I've...

1255
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:13,181
Sonia and I have been 
hanging out a little bit,

1256
01:38:13,306 --> 01:38:17,143
and I've been asking her about us.

1257
01:38:18,853 --> 01:38:21,481
Really? And what has she been saying?

1258
01:38:23,983 --> 01:38:27,695
That she doesn't think
you're seeing anyone right now.

1259
01:38:31,157 --> 01:38:33,367
She just happens to be right.

1260
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:39,248
You? Are you seeing anyone?

1261
01:38:44,712 --> 01:38:46,422
That's good.

1262
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:50,551
So, do you wanna 
go to the Cuban place?

1263
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:52,845
With me?

1264
01:38:54,514 --> 01:38:56,015
Okay.

1265
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:58,059
Okay.

1266
01:39:01,687 --> 01:39:05,066
What would you say to trying someplace
that we haven't been to before?

1267
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:06,859
Someplace new?

1268
01:39:07,777 --> 01:39:09,445
I'd like that.

1269
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:11,239
After you.
