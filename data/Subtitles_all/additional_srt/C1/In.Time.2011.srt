Two coffees.

in our evolution?

01:23:04,377 --> 01:23:07,107
there's no way they won't kill us, is there?

1000
01:23:09,715 --> 01:23:11,205
Do you regret this?

1001
01:23:12,385 --> 01:23:14,216
You saved my life.

1002
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:17,716
When?

1003
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:20,787
Now.

1004
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:23,718
And every day since I met you.

1005
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:31,131
You forget, I almost got you killed
a few times, too.

1006
01:23:33,573 --> 01:23:35,734
I'm willing to overlook that.

1007
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:54,086
How's the poor little rich girl?

1008
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:56,728
I never got a chance to

1009
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:00,091
properly thank you for your time.

1010
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:03,758
I'm not surprised you stayed.

1011
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,602
It's the life, isn't it?

1012
01:24:07,273 --> 01:24:09,605
Here we don't stop living

1013
01:24:09,942 --> 01:24:12,775
until we're actually dead.

1014
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:16,377
There are a lot more ways
to die around here.

1015
01:24:17,283 --> 01:24:20,275
But here, there's dancing before dying.

1016
01:24:28,127 --> 01:24:31,858
Of course, it's your friend
I'm most happy to run into again.

1017
01:24:32,298 --> 01:24:35,631
You've been causing a lot of trouble,
which is normally my job.

1018
01:24:36,035 --> 01:24:37,229
Don't you understand?

1019
01:24:38,204 --> 01:24:42,800
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone
is 'cause I have boundaries.

1020
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:45,366
I steal from my own people.

1021

You surely know things are bad
when I have to restore order.

1022

I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.

1024

but I prefer not to.

1025
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,561
I think you deserve a fighting chance.

1026
01:25:20,513 --> 01:25:22,242
We play to zero.

1027
01:25:23,249 --> 01:25:24,739

1028
01:25:25,351 --> 01:25:29,014
I lose, I die. I win, they kill me.

1029
01:25:30,356 --> 01:25:33,519
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.

1030
01:25:34,093 --> 01:25:35,117
And her?

1031
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:38,087
After I take you,

1032
01:25:39,031 --> 01:25:40,089
I'll take her.

1033
01:25:43,869 --> 01:25:46,201
Oh, yeah. And her time.

1034
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:49,331
Then I'll collect my reward

1035
01:25:49,408 --> 01:25:51,876

All the time he's taken.

Don't you mean the time
he's given away, sir?

Even to you?

1043
01:27:39,852 --> 01:27:44,687
I have given 50 years of my life to this job.

1044

those years go to waste.

Go on.

1046

I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you,

1047
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:13,612
but by tomorrow

1048

We lost. We're not doing any good.

1052
01:28:43,649 --> 01:28:44,877
At least we're trying.

1053
01:28:45,918 --> 01:28:50,252
No. You don't understand. All they have to
do is keep raising the cost of living.

1054
01:28:50,589 --> 01:28:54,252
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing.

1055

So, what? We just stop fighting?

1056
01:28:56,328 --> 01:28:59,058
We can't win. We can't hurt them.

1057
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:01,065
The time we're taking
makes no damn difference!

1058
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:03,260
What would? What would hurt them?

A million years.
You got a million years on you?

1060
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:14,101
I guess it really would take a million years.

1061

since I last saw you.

You'd steal from your own father.

Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

1078

What's the combination?

1079

Well, it's not my birthday.

There really is a man with a million years.

That's my first million. It won't be my last.

You know how much good it could do?

I know how much harm it could do.

1091

even if you gave a year to a million people,

you're just prolonging their agony.

You're prolonging their lives.

years, it could cripple the system.

if you've ever lived a day in your life.

One of us can make it. Take mine.
