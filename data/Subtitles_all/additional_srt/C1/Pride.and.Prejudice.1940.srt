Either the shell-pink
gossamer muslin

or the figured damask

6
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,941

7
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,902
Eh, now, let me see.

8
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,739
Yes. Yes, the pink suits you, Jane.

9
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,282
And now we'll see whether the blue

10
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,825
is becoming to you, Lizzy.

11
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,951
Stand up, dear.

12
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,664
Several young ladies have bought
new gowns for the Assembly Ball,

13
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,084
but none will be more modish
than this muslin, madam.

14
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,211
Isn't silk brocade
being very much worn?

15
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,255
Mine is, Mama.
It's been worn for three years.

16
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,635
Um, fashion decrees muslin
this season, madam.

17
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,595
That should be good enough for us,
shouldn't it, Jane?

18
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,554
Yes.

19
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,683
Then, uh, pink for Miss Jane
and blue for Miss Elizabeth.

20
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,143
I know exactly how I want mine cut.

21
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,270
I shall look very worldly.

22
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
How shall I look?

23
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,900
Adorable, my love, as always.

24
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,485
- Oh, Lizzy.
- Mm-hm.

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,446
Hey, Mr. Beck. Mr. Beck, look.

26
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,122
Looks-a-daisy, what a commotion.

27
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,209
Just look at that carriage, my love,

28
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,753
and those exquisite young men.

29
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,839
They must've come straight from court.

30
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,056
Oh, look, they're getting out.

31
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,975

of our neighbors say

32
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,685
if they're expecting visitors?

33
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,978
No, Mama.

34
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,481
Who do you suppose would be entertaining
people of fashion like these?

35
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,900
Mr. Beck, eh, send over to the inn

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,111
and find out if they're stopping
in the vicinity.

37
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,571
Eh, slyly, of course.

38
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,740
Oh, the hostler will tell us.

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,370
La, here comes Aunt Philips

40
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,747
as if something were after her.

41
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,501
Looks-a-daisy, my sister's lost
all sense of decorum.

42
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,337
Aunt Philips, oh, why such haste?

43
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,630
Oh, you're out of breath.

44
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,591
I saw your carriage outside.

45
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,470
My dear, such news.
Did you see them?

46
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,180
Of course we saw them.
Who are they, sister?

47
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,182
They're the new tenants
of Netherfield Park.

48
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,476
Netherfield Park is let at last.

49
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,269
And to a young man of importance.

50
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,562
His name is Bingley.

51
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,689
Is the young woman Mrs. Bingley?

52
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,233
No, dear.
That's the pleasantest part of It.

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,568
She's his sister.

54
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,945
She's his sister, Lizzy.

55
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,032
Who's the other gentleman,
Aunt Philips?

56
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,242
Oh, I don't know.
Some friend, I suppose.

57
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,203
Oh, but let me tell you about
Mr. Bingley.

58
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,831
He's very rich.
He has 5,000 pounds a year.

59
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,125
Five thousand pounds and unmarried.

60
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,960
That's the most heartening piece of news

61
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,378
since the Battle of Waterloo.

62
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,132
You can see how handsome
and elegant he is.

63
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,342
Excuse me, madam,

64
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,385
the second gentleman's name is Darcy.

65
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,596
The two carriages and
the dogs are his.

66
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,765
The chaise belongs to Mr. Bingley.

67
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,934
Two carriages and--

68
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,685
one, two, three, four, five--

69
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,854
six liveried servants.

70
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,358
My word, this Mr. Darcy must also be rich.

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,611
I wonder if he's married.

72
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,947
Ah, Mrs. Bennet,

73
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,407
I thought we'd find you here.

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,328
Good morning, Mrs. Philips.
Elizabeth, Jane.

75
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,997
I just had to come in
and tell you the news.

76
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,332
Dear Lady Lucas, you don't mean

77
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,626
about, ah, the new tenants
of Netherfield?

78
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,795
Ye--oh, you've heard it already?

79
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,712
Yes, dear.

80
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,757
Mr. Bingley has 5,000 pounds a year.

81
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,843
Who is this Mr. Darcy?

82
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,511
He's Mr. Bingley's guest.

83
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,680
They're inseparable friends.

84
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,682
He's one of the Darcys of Pemberley.

85
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,809
Oh, Mr. Darcy of Pemberley.

86
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,310
Is that all you know about him?

87
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,771
What--? Oh, you mean, is he married?

88
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,898
No, dear.
No, he isn't married.

89
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,442
And he's even richer than Mr. Bingley.

90
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,572
The Pemberley Estates alone are worth
a clear 10,000 a year.

91
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,656
Ten thou--?

92
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,742
Isn't it fortunate
to have two eligible young men

93
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,952
come into the neighborhood?

94
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,454
Perhaps one of them will fall
in love with you, Charlotte.

95
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, not if he sees Jane or Lizzy first.

96
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,835
You may not have beauty, my love,

97
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,213
but you have character,
and some men prefer it.

98
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,882
How true, Lady Lucas.

99
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,135
That's why girls who have both
are doubly fortunate.

100
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,136
Come, my dears.

101
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,724
The dressmaker will call
for the muslin, Mr. Beck.

102
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,058
Why such haste, Mama?

103
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:32,934
Shh.

104
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,436
Good morning, Lady Lucas.

105
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,187
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Bennet.

106
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,898
We shall meet
at the Assembly Ball, of course.

107
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,025
Yes, indeed.
Goodbye, sister.

108
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,028
Oh, you mustn't leave, Lady Lucas,
till Mr. Beck has shown you

109
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,572
that exquisite piece
of flower damask.

110
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,740
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

111
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,034
- Goodbye, Lady Lucas.
- Goodbye.

112
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,911
Come over to Longbourn soon, Charlotte.

113
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,037
Mama.

114
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,331
Heaven only knows
where your sisters are,

115
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,540
and we must get home at once.

116
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,750
But, Mama, why?

117
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,085
Your father must call
on Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy

118
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,253
this very afternoon.

119
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,380
If he doesn't, the Lucases will.

120
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,715
Now, there's no time to be lost.

121
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,677
But the damask, milady.

122
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,846
Oh, we'll choose the material
some other time, Mr. Beck.

123
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:10,764
Come, Charlotte.

124
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,142
Hurry, my dear.

125
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,271
Where are those girls?

126
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,523
Whenever I want them,
I never can find them.

127
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,526
- There's Mary, Mama.
- Ye--oh, Mary.

128
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,736
Mary!

129
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,782
Isn't that just like the girl.

130
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,075
Eh, eh, Mary.

131
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,036

Come out.

134

I have just purchased Burke's essay

135

on the sublime and beautiful.

136
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,639
You and your books.

137
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,891
No wonder you're compelled
to wear disfiguring glasses.

Oh, where are Kitty and Lydia?

139
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,646
Look for an officer in a red coat

140
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,522
and you'll find them.

141
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,691
Y--Officers, yes.
Come, girls.

142
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,035
Oh, yeah?

143
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,623
Is that the way you'd treat a wife,
Mr. Wickham?

144
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,709
More likely to be the way she'd treat me,
Miss Lydia.

145
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,002
Oh, Mama,
there they are.

146
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,420
Where?

147
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,088
There. Look.

148
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,674
Kitty, there's Mama.

149

Kitty, Lydia. Eh, eh--come here.

I don't know why you permit it, Mama.

152

myself when I was young.

00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,126
Netherfield Park has been let at last.

179
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,168
Mm-hm.

180
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,670
Did you hear me?

181
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,922
Netherfield Park has been let at last.

182
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,090
Indeed, Mrs. Bennet.

183
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,425
Well, don't you want to hear
who's taken it?

184
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,677
Well, you want to tell me.

185
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,345
I have no objection to hearing it.

186
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,888
Mr. Bingley is his name,

187
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,641
and it seems he's a young man
of large fortune.

188
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,978
And he's single, my dear. Think of it.

189
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,106
What a fine thing for our girls.

190
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:48,982
Is it?

191
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,026
Mr. Bennet, you know
perfectly well what I mean.

192
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,362
I'm thinking of his marrying
one of our daughters.

193
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,283
Oh, is that his design in settling here?

194
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,202
How can you talk so, Mr. Bennet?

195
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,912
This is a serious matter.

196
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,998
You must go and visit him at once.

197
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,457
You and the girls go.

198
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,544
Or better still,
send the girls by themselves.

199
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,921
For you're as handsome as any of them,

200
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,340
and Mr. Bingley may like you best of all.

201
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,967
Oh, my dear, you flatter me.

202
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,678
When a woman has
five grown-up daughters,

203
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,055
she ought to give over
thinking of her own beauty.

204
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,266
Well, in most such cases,
a woman hasn't much beauty

205
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,475
to think of, my dear.

206
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,478
Now, seriously, Mr. Bennet,

207
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,480
you must go and see Mr. Bingley.

208
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,357
If you don't, Sir William and Lady Lucas

209
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,443
will get there before us. Hm-hm!

210
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,653
You should've seen her
galloping her horses

211
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,614
to beat me from the village just now.

212
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,823
Did she win?

213
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,659
Ha! Indeed she did not.

214
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,621
But she'd stop at nothing

215
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,040
to get Mr. Bingley interested
in her Charlotte.

216
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,666
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, my dear.

217
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,668
I'll write to assure him
of my hearty consent

218
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,921
to his marrying whichever
he chooses of the girls.

219
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,757
Though I must throw in
a good word for my Lizzy.

220
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,593
Elizabeth is not one whit
better than the others,

221
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,887
but you always give her the preference.

222
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,557
Oh, they're all silly
and ignorant, like most girls.

223
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,769
But Lizzy has some glimmerings of sense.

224
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:08,937
Mr. Bennet,

225
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,898
how can you abuse
your own children in such a way?

226
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,276
You take delight in vexing me.

227
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,405
You've no compassion on my poor nerves.

228
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,533
Oh, you mistake me, my dear.

229
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,827
I have the highest respect
for your nerves.

230
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,205
I have heard you mention them
with consideration

231
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,915
for the last 20 years.

232
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,459
How can you be so resigned
to your daughters

233
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,878
growing up to be penniless old maids?

234
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,214
Leaving everything
to that cousin of yours,

235
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,591
that--that odious Mr. Collins.

236
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,802
Mrs. Bennet,
for the thousandth time,

237
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,638
this estate was entailed
when I inherited it.

238
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,099
It must, by law, go to a male heir.

239
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,476
A male heir, Mrs. Bennet.

240
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,313
And as possibly you remember,
we have no son.

241
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,440
All the more reason

242
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,317
why you should take
some responsibility

243
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,486
about getting husbands for them.

244
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,572
No, you escape into
your unintelligible books

245
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,199
and leave everything to me.

246
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,161
Look at them.

247
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,247
Five of them without dowries.

248
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,790
What's to become of them?

249
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,253
Yes, what is to become
of the wretched creatures?

250
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,298
Perhaps we should've
drowned some of them at birth.

251
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,508
Mr. Bennet.

252
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm glad you didn't drown me, Papa.

253
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,888
Much too nice just being alive,

254
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,265
even if I never have a husband.

255
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,684
Well, I hope Mr. Bingley likes the hat.

256
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,104
We are not in the way of knowing
what Mr. Bingley likes,

257
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,397
since we're not to meet him.

258
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,648
Mary, stop pecking.

259
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,276
Don't keep on coughing, Kitty.
Good heavens,

260
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,820
have a little compassion
on my poor nerves.

261
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,822
Oh, Kitty has no discretion
in her coughs.

262
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,073
She times them ill.

263
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,409
I don't cough
for my own amusement, Mama.

264
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,995
Mama, why aren't we to meet
Mr. Bingley?

265
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,747
Don't speak about Mr. Bingley.

266
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,123
I'm sick of him.

267
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,751
Eh? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, my dear.

268
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,836
If I'd known that you'd feel like this,

269
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:57,920
I shouldn't have gone
out of my way

270
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,297
to make his acquaintance last week.

271
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,465
Papa!

272
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,925
Oh, it's very unlucky.

273
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,303
I even gave him tickets
to the Assembly Ball.

274
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,140
And I believe he intends to make himself
known to you there.

275
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,435
Mr. Bennet, you've been acquainted
with him all the time.

276
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,645
Since he signed his lease
at Netherfield, my dear.

277
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,400
Did you tell him that you had
five daughters, Papa?

278
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,528
Well, I told him if he ran into
five of the silliest girls in England,

279
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,739
they would be my daughters.

280
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,138
Do you suppose our neighbors
from Netherfield are not coming?

281
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,307
Very discourteous if they don't,

282
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,518
considering Mr. Bennet gave them tickets.

283
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,497
Don't you think we dance
beautifully together, Mr. Wickham?

284
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,749
I suspect you dance beautifully
with anyone, Miss Lydia,

285
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,251
and I know I don't.

286
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,562
Tell me, who is the lovely creature
in the blue dress?

287
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,649
That lovely creature
is my sister Elizabeth.

288
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,359
Ah, then I'm in luck.

289
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,611
Please present me
when the dance is over.

290
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,490
Lizzy, this is Mr. Wickham.

291
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,950
He wants to meet you.

292
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,994
He thinks you're a lovely creature.

293
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,208
Someday I'll tell you
what sort of a creature you are.

294
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,967
After that introduction, I hardly know
how to begin, Miss Elizabeth.

295
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,011
Shall I offer a remark on the weather?

296
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,222
If you can make it fit
for a young lady's ears.

297
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,140
You're right.

298
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,850
The weather's too dangerous a subject.

299
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:16,767
To be quite safe,

300
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,936
I shall ask you
how you like it here in Meryton.

301
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,063
Ah, that's anything but safe.

302
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,234
I'm just discovering
that I like it prodigiously.

303
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,408
I hope you'll ask me when I began

304
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,076
to like it so prodigiously,
Miss Elizabeth.

305
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,536
I will.

306
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,998
- When did you?
- Uh--

307
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,881
- The moment I saw you.
- Very pretty, sir.

308
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,800
Shall I tell you what I thought
the moment I saw you?

309
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,053
- Only if it's pleasant.
- It is. I thought--

310
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,142
You were going to say,
Miss Elizabeth?

311
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,686
Oh, yes. I'm sorry, I forget.

312
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,943
♪♪

313
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,948
Ladies and gentlemen,

314
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,618
Miss Bingley, Mr. Bingley
and Mr. Darcy.

315
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,662
This is indeed an honor.

316
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,581
Very distinguished.

317
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,376
Uh, Kitty, Kitty,
your dress is too décolleté,

318
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,252
pull it up a little.

319
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,837
Uh, Lydia--Lydia,
there's perspiration on your nose.

320
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,173
Don't get so hot.
It's very unladylike.

321
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,509
- Oh, Jane. Jane, dear.
- Yes, Mama?

322
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,262
Of course,
you're quite perfect, my dear.

323
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,681
Lizzy, Lizzy, do try to make
a good impression.

324
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,766
You can be so appealing
when you want to be.

325
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,311
Oh, uh, Mary,
try to sparkle a little.

326
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,522
Just a little.

327
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,867
- A waltz, Mr. Darcy.
- Yes.

328
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,078
- How modern.
- Yes, indeed.

329
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,123
- Shall we have our dance now?
- If you care to.

330
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,305
What a handsome young man
Mr. Darcy is.

331
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,848
And so rich too.

332
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,102
His mother was a daughter
of the Marquis of Scarlingford.

333
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,814
Did you hear that, Jane?
The Marquis of Scarlingford.

334
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,109
- And doesn't he know it.
- I like Mr. Bingley better.

335
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,611
Mr. Darcy's so--

336
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,154
So supercilious.

337
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,365
And my goodness,
he does have an air about him.

338
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,040
Pray, Sir William,
who is that uncommonly handsome girl?

339
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,082
Who?

340
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,459
Over there, next to the pillar.

341
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,337
Oh, that's Miss Bennet.

342
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,007
This is our dance, Miss Elizabeth.

343
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,188
Oh, Mrs. Bennet,
may I present Mr. Bingley?

344
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,440
Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Philips,

345
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,443
Miss Jane Bennet,
Miss Mary Bennet.

346
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,449
Mr. Bingley, we're all so delighted
that you've taken Netherfield.

347
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,742
Having it standing empty

348
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,911
was a loss to
the whole neighborhood,

349
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,331
like an oyster shell
without an oyster in it.

350
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,375
Well, here is the oyster, madam.

351
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,627
But if I may be permitted to say so,

352
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,337
it is you who have the pearl.

353
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,297
Charming, charming.

354
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,049
Oh, uh, Jane, dear,

355
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,134
why don't
you say something to Mr. Bingley?

356
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,679
Good evening, sir.

357
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,181
May I have the honor
of this dance, Miss Bennet?

358
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,933
With pleasure.

359
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,690
Think of having a daughter
happily settled at Netherfield.

360
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,776
She'll be pricing
wedding garments tomorrow.

361
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,239
Hey, Jemima.
Stop scratching yourself.

362
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,198
Yes, Mama.

363
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,293
Well, is Miss Bingley engaged
to Mr. Darcy?

364
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,628
If she Is,
she ought to break It.

365
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,462
Why?

366
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,965
No man can be in love
and look so bored.

367
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,509
Did you ever see such people,
Mr. Darcy?

368
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,553
Really, I think my brother
ought to apologize

369
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,179
for bringing us
to a place like this.

370
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,306
He's so dreadfully undiscriminating.

371
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,226
He seems to be able to
enjoy himself in any society.

372
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,395
I'm not surprised at his being
able to enjoy himself...

373
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,063
in that society.

374
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,023
You know, Miss Bennet, you've done
a very extraordinary thing.

375
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,358
- What?
- You have talked to me

376
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,693
about all your friends in Meryton

377
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,737
without saying one malicious word.

378
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,613
Oh, but they're all such agreeable people,

379
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
so kind and pleasant.

380
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,659
That never prevented anyone
from talking maliciously.

381
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,637
- Your health.
- Your health.

382
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,431
Uh-uh, no heel-tapping, Miss Kitty.

383
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,432
Down in one gulp.

384
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,814
Don't cough, chicken.
Put your hands over your head.

385
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,234
Oh, look, they're dancing.
That should help you.

386
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,407
My goodness, what a hullabaloo.

387
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,534
One is only young once.

388
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,204
That odious Mr. Darcy,

389
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,997
looking down his nose at everybody.

390
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,624
Does he think he's
too good for us?

391
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,708
Come, sister.

392
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,180
Isn't that delightful,
your like riding as much as I do?

393
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,014
Yes.

394
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,891
I hope we may be able
to ride together sometime.

395
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,060
- That would be nice.
- Why, Caroline.

396
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,562
Miss Jane, will you take
a little stroll about the room with me?

397
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,772
With pleasure.

398
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,607
Oh, no, Charles,
you were not invited.

399
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,109
I have a thousand things
I want to ask Miss Jane.

400
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,742
You know, I have a feeling
about Mr. Bingley and Jane.

401
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,912
I really have.
Look, look, sister.

402
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,418
Miss Bingley is being
excessively gracious to Jane.

403
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,338
What did I tell you?
It's a sure sign.

404
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,550
You must come over
to Netherfield one day.

405
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,676
I shall be so bored.

406
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,094
- What?
- Oh, you know,

407
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,096
marooned out here in the wilderness.

408
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,223
We'll arrange it,
shall we, very soon?

409
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,432
That would be delightful.

410
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,541
Oh, isn't this better than
brazening it out in the open?

411
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,459
No one can tell
we haven't partners here.

412
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,588
Oh, why is England cursed with
so many more women than men?

413
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,716
Darcy.

414
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,013
Come, I hate to see you stalking about
by yourself in a stupid manner.

415
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,681
- Why don't you dance?
- With whom?

416
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,475
Your sister is engaged and
there isn't another woman in the room

417
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,686
that it wouldn't be a punishment
for me to stand up with.

418
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,855
But the place is full of pretty girls.

419
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,733
I've noticed only one, and
you seem to have monopolized her.

420
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,234
Yes, isn't she lovely?

421
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,570
But there's that sister of hers,
Miss Elizabeth.

422
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,322
They say she has a lively wit.

423
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,782
Provincial young lady with a lively wit.

424
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,659
Heaven preserve us.
And there's that mother of hers.

425
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,453
It's not the mother
you have to dance with, Darcy.

426
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,163
It's the daughter.
She's charming.

427
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,248
Yes, she looks tolerable enough.

428
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,626
But I'm in no humor tonight
to give consequence

429
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,377
to the middle classes at play.

430
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,760
What a charming man.

431
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,474
Of all the arrogant, detestable snobs.

432
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,559
Oh, but, Lizzy,
he didn't know you were listening.

433
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:56,602
What difference does that make?

434
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,395
He'd have said it
just the same if he had.

435
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,690
"Oh, she looks tolerable enough,

436
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,777
but I'm in no humor tonight
to give consequence

437
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,904
to the middle classes at play."

438
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,282
And think how we badgered
poor Papa to get him here.

439
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,242
- Oh, I could--
- Oh, praise heaven.

440
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,787
I have this dance
engaged with Canon Stubbs.

441
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,206
He's never learned the steps,
but he likes the exercise.

442
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,166
And it gets me away from the wall.

443
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,311
- Um, but as I was saying--
- I was about to ask you, Sir William,

444
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,814
if you would do me the kindness
to introduce me to Miss Bennet?

445
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,273
Oh, certainly, yes.

446
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,651
Dancing is a charming amusement
for young people.

447
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,737
In my opinion,
it's one of the first refinements

448
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,322
of a polished society.

449
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,615
It has the added advantage, sir,

450
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,742
of being one of the first refinements
of savages.

451
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,704
- Every Hottentot can dance.
- Yes, yes, quite so.

452
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,415
80, Miss Elizabeth,

453
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,292
may I have the honor
to present Mr. Darcy?

454
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,962
He's eager to invite you to dance.

455
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,216
Now that you've been forewarned
of my eagerness to dance with you,

456
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,343
may I hope that you will
do me the honor?

457
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,971
I am afraid that the honor
of standing up with you,

458
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,056
Mr. Darcy,
is more than I can bear.

459
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,933
Pray, excuse me.

460
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,727
Am I to understand that you

461
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,770
do not wish to dance with me,
Miss Bennet?

462
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,481
Sir, I am begging to be excused.

463
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,235
The loss is mine, I'm sure.

464
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,696
You perhaps know best about that, sir.

465
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,867
Miss Elizabeth,
if you're not engaged,

466
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,452
will you honor me
with the next dance?

467
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,537
I should be very happy
to dance with you.

468
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,373
Oh, this is Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy.

469
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,209
Mr. Darcy and I have met before.

470
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,254
We have indeed.

471
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,592
The man must be mad.

472
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,678
Mad? You're too charitable,
Miss Elizabeth.

473
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,599
If you were better acquainted,
you'd see in him another man.

474
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,142
Have you known him a long time?

475
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,810
Yes, since childhood.

476
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,021
But as you saw,
we're not on friendly terms.

477
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,232
Without knowing anything about it,
I'm on your side.

478
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,817
Thank you, Miss Elizabeth.

479
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,945
You see, my father was steward
at the Darcy estate.

480
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
Young Darcy and I grew up together,

481
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,407
almost like brothers.

482
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,327
But I mustn't trust myself
on that subject.

483
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,537
After what Darcy has done to me, I...

484
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,456
I wouldn't be a fair judge.

485
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,751
Oh, polka-mazurka.

486
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,921
I didn't expect to find Meryton
abreast with the new fashion.

487
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,964
You underrate us, Mr. Wickham.

488
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,092
Meryton is abreast of everything.

489
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,512
Everything except insolence
and bad manners.

490
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,640
Those London fashions
we do not admire.

491
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,425
Things are working out exactly as I hoped

492
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,137
the first minute I set eyes
on Mr. Bingley.

493
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,596
What's this about Mr. Bingley?

494
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,431
I'm dining with him
and his sister, Papa.

495
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,976
- This is the day.
- Oh, great and fateful day.

496
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,979
Mama, do you suppose
they'll have turtle soup for dinner?

497
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,814
They're so frightfully rich.

498
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,899
No, dear,
you--you can't expect turtle soup

499
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,943
until the engagement
is actually announced.

500
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,154
Now, Jane,
don't forget what I told you.

501
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,239
Eh, don't be too distant with him,

502
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,908
and be sure and laugh
when he makes a joke.

503
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,160
Yes, even if it's a bad one.

504
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,911
Especially if it's a bad one.

505
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,415
And try to sit where
he can see you in profile.

506
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,584
You know, dear,
although I say it, I shouldn't,

507
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,253
you have the loveliest profile
in all Herefordshire.

508
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,754
Mama.

509
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,090
♪♪

510
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,096
Oh, and, Jane,
if Mr. Bingley should suggest

511
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,682
a stroll before dinner,
don't refuse.

512
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,893
There are such delightfully secluded walks

513
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,394
in those shrubberies
around Netherfield.

514
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,187
Yes, Mama.

515
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,439
There won't be much
strolling today, Mama.

516
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,775
Oh, dear me, Lizzy,
I'm afraid you're right.

517
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,778
Oh, and I had such hopes
of those shrubberies.

518
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,656
Get out, Jane.
Get out, dear, at once.

519
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,741
But, Mama, I want to go.

520
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:21,783
Who said you weren't going?

521
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,952
Get out and change
your clothes immediately.

522
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,288
Uh, take the carriage
back to the stables, Jennings,

523
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,707
and tell the boy to saddle
Miss Jane's horse.

524
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,793
Oh, but, Mama, you can't send
Jane out on horseback.

525
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,754
It's going to rain,
and she'll catch a cold.

526
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,757
Oh, fiddlesticks, people don't catch
cold from a few drops of water.

527
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,843
Besides, if it rains she won't be able
to ride home after dinner.

528
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,386
They'll have to keep her all night.

529
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,181
You know, dear, there isn't a thing like
wet weather for engagements.

530
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,434
Your dear father and I became
engaged in a thunderstorm.

Oh, no. Mother will be delight--

I mean, she'll be grateful
I'm with such good friends.

Now, open your mouth.

00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,408
Say "ah."

541
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,201
Ah?

542
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,370
- Once more. "Ah."
- Ah.

543
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,248
A-a-achoo!

544
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,212
The epidermis seems to have
lost its sudorific activity.

545
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,632
I detect distinct symptoms of pyrexia.

546
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,718
Oh, is that bad, Dr. McIntosh?

547
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,053
He just means you're
rather feverish, Miss Jane.

548
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,929
Oh.

549
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,599
There is also acute coryza
of the nasal cavities,

550
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,394
accompanied by local
inflammation of the larynx.

551
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,272
Not to mention
some pulmonary congestion

552
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,483
and neuralgic pains
in the temporal region.

553
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,152
In other words, Miss Jane,

554
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,362
you have a bad cold
and a headache.

555
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,033
What do you want us to do, doctor?

556
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,994
I would advise the immediate
application of a sinapism.

557
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,788
A sidapisup?
A mustard plaster.

558
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,916
There seems to be someone
coming up the drive.

559
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,588
It would appear to be
one of your sisters.

560
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,381
Miss Elizabeth.

561
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,674
Well, I'll go down and meet her.

562
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,054
Come in, Miss Elizabeth.

563
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,597
Oh.

564
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,684
How do you do, Mr. Bingley?
We got Jane's note this morning.

565
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,353
She will be so happy to see you.

566
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,104
Thank you.

567
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,782
Uh, this way, Miss Elizabeth.

568
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,333
Please forgive me, Miss Bingley,

569
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,001
I'm afraid it's a great intrusion.

570
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,629
My uneasiness about my sister
must be my excuse.

571
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,381
It's just a little cold, that's all.

572
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,716
Ah, but Dr. McIntosh says
there's some fever.

573
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,594
It doesn't amount to anything.
Nothing to get agitated about.

574
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,388
I thought I heard your voice,
Miss Elizabeth.

575
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,889
Have you come to visit your sister?

576
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,433
And she seems actually to have walked.

577
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,061
The horses were needed at the farm.

578
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,562
I had no alternative.

579
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,023
- You didn't come alone, I hope.
- All alone.

580
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,358
But how shocking.

581
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,151
Don't you think so, Mr. Darcy?

582
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,279
Is it shocking for a young lady
to be concerned about her sister?

583
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,616
But to have come all this way
unaccompanied, and on foot.

584
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,494
Mr. Bingley, would it be
possible for me to see Jane?

585
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,204

She is much better.

Yes, but to Jane must go all the credit

602
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,126
for having caught the cold, my dear.

603
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,378
How much longer
are Elizabeth and Jane

604
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,504
going to stay at Netherfield?

605
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,298
Well, we're hoping Elizabeth can manage

606
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,632
to catch a cold of her own

607
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,218
and stay long enough
to get engaged to Mr. Darcy.

608
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,888
Then if a good snowstorm
could be arranged,

609
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,056
we'd send Kitty over.

610
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,142
And if a young man should happen
to be in the house,

611
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,394
a young man who likes
singing, of course,

612
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,771
and can discuss philosophy,
Mary could go.

613
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,233
Then, if a dashing young soldier

614
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,402
in a handsome uniform
should appear for Lydia,

615
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,529
everything would be perfect, my dear.

616
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,656
Just a little marmalade please,
Kitty darling.

617
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,576
That's 20 and 10 for the game.

618
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,161
I have two and 20, I believe.

619
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,662
Ah.

620
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,457
Miss Eliza, is your patient asleep?

621
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,791
Is she better, Miss Elizabeth?

622
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,376
Yes, her fever is quite gone.

623
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,213
I'm so glad.
Will you join us In a game of cards?

624
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,798
No, thank you. Please continue
with whatever you were playing.

625
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,259
I'd enjoy looking at
some of your books, if I may.

626
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,470
Miss Eliza is a great reader, I'm sure,

627
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,348
and has no pleasure in anything
so frivolous as cards.

628
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,391
Hm. Is that true, Miss Elizabeth?

629
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,019
Not at all.
I'm not a great reader,

630
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,772
and I have pleasure in many
frivolous things. Thank you.

631
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,107
I'm sure you have pleasure
in nursing your sister,

632
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,776
and I hope it will soon be increased

633
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,027
by seeing her quite well.

634
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,446
Thank you. I think she may
be taken home tomorrow.

635
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,323
- Oh, not so soon.
- I'm afraid so.

636
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,992
You see, my mother's expecting
a visit from our cousin Collins,

637
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,327
whom none of us has ever seen.

638
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,454
Naturally, you're curious to see her.

639
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,665
My cousin Collins is a man,

640
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,501
but we are curious to see him. Naturally.

641
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,795
Miss Jane mustn't go out
until the doctor advises it,

642
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,004
cousin or no cousin.

643
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,423
There are others in the library
if you care for none of these.

644
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,384
This will suit me perfectly, thank you.

645
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,720
What a delightful library
you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy.

646
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,223
It ought to be good.
It's the work of many generations.

647
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,891
Shall we continue, Darcy?

648
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,060
Oh, you and Miss Bingley play.

649
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,145
I really must finish my letter
to my sister.

650
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,274
How I long to see
your sister again, Mr. Darcy.

651
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,901
I've never met anyone
who delighted me so much.

652
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,362
Such a countenance, such manners.

653
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,448
And so extremely accomplished
for one of her age.

654
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,158
It's amazing to me how young ladies

655
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,578
can have the patience to be
so accomplished as they all are.

656
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,539
All young ladies
are not accomplished, Charles.

657
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,623
All I know are.

658
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,167
Aren't all you know
accomplished, Darcy?

659
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,671
I can't boast of knowing more than
half a dozen who are really so.

660
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,089
Nor I.

661
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,216
What do you think, Miss Eliza?

662
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,637
I think that you and Mr. Darcy
must comprehend a great deal

663
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,598
in your idea
of the accomplished woman.

664
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,141
I do.

665
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,183
Oh, certainly.

666
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,019
No one can really
be esteemed accomplished

667
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,353
unless she has
a thorough knowledge

668
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,147
of music, singing, dancing,

669
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,733
and the modern languages.

670
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,360
Besides, she must
also possess a certain something

671
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,029
in the tone of her voice,

672
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,823
in her address,
in her expressions,

673
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,451
as well as in her figure and carriage.

674
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,786
To which she must add
something more substantial

675
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,789
in the improvement of her mind,
by extensive reading.

676
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,669
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing

677
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,129
only six accomplished women.

678
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,839
I wonder at your knowing any.

679
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,676
Caroline, are we to discuss
this subject further,

680
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,386
or shall we play piquet?

681
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,555
Oh, I don't wish to play cards, Charles.

682
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,349
I think I'd prefer a book too.

683
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,602
After all,
there's no enjoyment like reading.

684
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,814
I'll play with you, Mr. Bingley.

685
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,775
Will you cut?

686
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,863
- Do you like dancing, Miss Elizabeth?
- Love It.

687
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,282
As soon as your sister has
fully recovered, I'll give a ball.

688
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,159
Oh, that's a delightful idea.

689
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,994
Pray, tell your sister
that I am delighted

690
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,746
to hear of her progress in music.

691
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,831
And let her know
that I am quite in raptures

692
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,708
with her beautiful little design
for a table.

693
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,795
Will you allow me to defer your
raptures until I write again?

694
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,505
I really haven't room to do them justice.

695
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,965
It's of no consequence.
I shall see her soon.

696
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,344
I'm hungry. May I get you
some food, Miss Elizabeth?

697
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,387
No, thank you.

698
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,263
Miss Eliza, let me persuade you

699
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,432
to join me in taking a turn
about the room.

700
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,143
You'll find it very refreshing
after sitting for so long.

701
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,228
With pleasure.

702
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,106
Mr. Darcy, would you join us?

703
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,565
Uh, no, thank you.

704
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,027
I can imagine only two motives
for your walking,

705
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,030
with either of which
my joining you would interfere.

706
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,617
What does he mean by that,
Miss Elizabeth?

707
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,452
If I read his character correctly,

708
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,329
he means to be severe upon us.

709
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,373
And the best way of disappointing him

710
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,500
is not to ask.

711
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,837
I'm not sure that your character reading
is too brilliant, Miss Elizabeth.

712
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,797
Anyway, I must know.

713
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,466
Pray, explain what the two motives
might be, Mr. Darcy?

714
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,427
I have not the smallest objection
to explaining.

715
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,804
Either you have
secret affairs to discuss,

716
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,472
or you are conscious that your figures

717
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,391
show to the greatest advantage
while walking.

718
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,394
In the first case,
I should be completely in your way.

719
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,272
And in the second, I can admire you
much better from where I am.

720
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,648
How perfectly abominable.

721
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,942
What should we do
to punish him, Miss Eliza?

722
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,610
As you know him so well,

723
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,404
I shall leave his punishment to you.

724
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,489
I must go up and see Jane.

725
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,825
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

726
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,120
Why disclaim punishment,
Miss Elizabeth,

727
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,581
when you deliberately inflict it
by leaving us so soon?

728
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,167
If my departure
is any punishment, Mr. Darcy,

729
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,418
you are quite right.

730
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,670
My character reading is not too brilliant.

731
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,089
Goodnight, sir.

732
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,813
Charming, my dear.
Charming.

733
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,648
But, uh, that will do.

734

Uh, Mary. Mary.

735
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,736
That's quite enough, dear.

736
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,701
I'm so glad I went
to fetch Jane myself,

737
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,204
if only to see the look
in Mr. Bingley's eyes

738
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,456
when he assisted her into the carriage.

739
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,666
Oh, Jane, clear, there you are.

740
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,628
Oh, Jane.

741
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:18,838
Are you feeling better, dearest?

742
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,256
Oh, much better.

743
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,636
Jane, dean
I was talking about dear Mr. Bingley.

744
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,180
What a charming son-in-law he'll be.

745
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,599
Why, he hasn't proposed yet,
has he, Mama?

746
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,975
He will.

747
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,436
I told him some things
about Jane before I left.

748
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,479
Mama.

749
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,441
Only that you have
the loveliest disposition in the world.

750
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,152

751
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,614
that you had declined any number
of marriage proposals.

752
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,115
Oh, Mama, you didn't.

753
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,201
Of course I did, didn't I, Lizzy?

754
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,203
I'm afraid you did, Mama.

755
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,122
And I set
that arrogant Mr. Darcy down, too,

756
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,415
before I left.

757
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,001
Did you hear what I said to him, Lizzy?

758
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,086
Yes.

00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,953
Any simple childish game
seems to amuse them excessively.

870
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,374
Good for you, Sir William.

871
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,220
Stop, stop, I'm going to fall!

872
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,722
Give another pull, Denny.

873
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,686
Miss Elizabeth.

874
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,274
Elizabeth.

875
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,403
Miss Elizabeth.

876
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,324
Miss Elizabeth.

877
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,705
Miss Elizabeth.

878
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,125
Miss Elizabeth.

879
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,753
Miss Elizabeth.

880
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,839
Why, I say, sir. Sir.
I beg your pardon, sir.

881
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,092
Do you--? Do you happen
to know Miss Elizabeth Bennet?

882
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,135
I do, sir.

883
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,638
Has she--?
Has she passed this way, may I ask?

884
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,185
No, sir, she has not passed this spot.

885
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,355
I suggest you try
the other side of the lake, sir.

886
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,773
I'm obliged to you, sir.

887
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,654
All clear.

888
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,575
Thank you, Mr. Darcy.

889
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,203
You've saved me from
one of the most dangerous bores

890
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,120
in the country.

891
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,622
If the dragon returns,

892
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,249
Saint George Will know
how to deal with him.

893
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,335
Meanwhile, what do you say
to a little target practice?

894
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,461
Very well.

895
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,888
Are you a good shot
with a bow and arrow, Mr. Darcy?

896
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,348
Tolerable.

897
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,308
Only tolerable?

898
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,352
Well, it's a fine old sport.

899
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,354
And one in which even a young lady

900
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,772
can become proficient.

901
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,524
So I've heard.

902
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,067
At a short range, of course.

903
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,402
And with a light bow.

904
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,534
Hm. What a bad shot.

905
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,995
Oh, on the contrary, well done.

906
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,872
Well, it might have been worse.

907
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,165
Now it's your turn.

908
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,127
Now, the bow in the left hand.

909
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:37,295
This way.

910
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,340
So the arrow goes like this.

911
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,303
That's right. Now, these,
uh, three fingers.

912
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,388
So one, two, three.

913
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,641
Now, the left arm straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

914
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,060
Now turn sideways toward the target.

915
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,895
Aim for the bull's-eye.

916
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:56,856
That's right.

917
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,029
Bull's-eye.

918
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,081
And another bull's-eye.

919
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,710
Next time I talk
to a young lady about archery,

920
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,128
I won't be so patronizing.

921
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,009
Yes, thank you for the lesson.

922
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,637
Thank you for taking it so well.

923
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,015
Most men would have been
offended, and rightly.

924
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,558
Would you mind telling me,
Miss Bennet,

925
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,310
why you're so determined
to offend me?

926
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,438
Is that possible, Mr. Darcy?
I thought you were invulnerable.

927
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,649
You always look so... impassive.

928
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,985
Perhaps you don't laugh enough.

929
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,988
You may be right.
But you haven't answered my question.

930
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,156
Mr. Darcy.

931
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,909
You promised to give me
a lesson with the darts.

932
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,911
I give no more instructions
to young ladies.

933
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,829
Hereafter,
they give Instructions to me.

934
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:54,914
What do you say, Miss Bingley?

935
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,416
Miss Elizabeth thinks
I do not laugh enough.

936
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,127
I should be sorry to see
you laugh more than you do.

937
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:04,048
To me there's something so unrefined
about excessive laughter.

938
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,674
Oh, if you want to be really refined,

939
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,759
you have to be dead.

940
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,387
There's no one
as dignified as a mummy.

941
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,394
And now may I ask you
a question, Mr. Darcy?

942
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,395
By all means.

943
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:19,522
What would you think of a man

944
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,941
who had everything
the world has to offer?

945
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,485
Birth, breeding, wealth.

946
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,195
Good looks.

947
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,490
Even charm when he chose to exercise it.

948
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,160
What would be your opinion
of a man with such gifts

949
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,038
who refused to accept
an introduction to another man

950
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,706
who was poor
and of no consequence?

951
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,459
I should reserve my opinion

952
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,045
until I knew the circumstances
of the particular case.

953
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,632
And do you suppose the gentleman
would reveal those circumstances

954
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:47,591
if he were asked?

955
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,551
No.

956
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,346
A gentleman does not
have to explain his actions.

957
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,058
He expects people to give him credit

958
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,562
for being a man of honor and integrity.

959
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,732
And now if you will excuse me,
I will retrieve the arrows.

960
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:12,992
Miss Eliza.

961
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,704
May I warn you as a friend

962
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,165
not to take George Wickham too seriously.

963
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,669
Oh. You knew I referred to Mr. Wickham?

964
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:24,753
Of course.

965
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,213
I know that he goes about saying

966
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,299
that he's been ill-used by Mr. Darcy.

967
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,301
While I'm ignorant of the particulars,

968
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,386
I know that what he says is not true.

969
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,763
How clever of you,
my dear Miss Bingley,

970
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,141
to know something
of which you are ignorant.

971
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,144
I've always found
George Wickham to be a man

972
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,146
of absolutely no principle.

973
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,858
But, though, what can you expect
of one of his low descent?

974
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,194
I will tell you exactly what I expect.

975
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:53,699
Kindness, honor, generosity, truthfulness.

976
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,368
And I might add that I expect
precisely the same

977
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,078
from persons of high descent.

978
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,002
Oh, Mr. Darcy,
Miss Bingley is eager for her lesson.

979
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,921
I hope you will enjoy it, Miss Bingley,

980
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,715
and that you will learn
to direct your darts

981
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,634
with greater accuracy.

982
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,346
Such insolence and bad manners.

983
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,975
Pray, what do you think
of her now, Mr. Darcy?

984
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,271
I think she handles
a bow and arrow superbly.

985
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:33,531
♪ Flow gently, sweet Afton,

Won't you favor us
with another selection?

1000
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,267
Well, if you really insist.

1001
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,768
Papa, you must make her stop.

1002
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,103
All right, dear. Shh, shh.

1003
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,777
Very good, Mary, dear.
Very good.

1004
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,280
But, Papa, this is another song.

1005
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,906
Eh? Oh.

1006
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,116
Oh, never mind, my dear.

1007
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,951
You've delighted us quite long enough.

1008
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,995
Give the other young ladies a chance

1009
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,830
to make exhibitions of themselves.

1010
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,712
Ah, Miss Elizabeth,
allow me to congratulate you.

1011
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:12,838
On what?

1012
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,506
On your family, of course.

1013
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,383
A talented young singer.

1014
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,844
A cousin distinguished
for his wit and learning.

1015
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,722
Two young sisters with a toast
of the officer's mess.

1016
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,933
A mother who's
a most diverting conversationalist.

1017
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,186
To say nothing of your own dexterity

1018
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,520
with bow and arrow.

1019
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,607
Such an interesting,
accomplished family.

1020
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:57,925
Miss Elizabeth,

1021
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,219
I'm afraid something
has happened to disturb you.

1022
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,846
Nothing at all, thank you.

1023
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,599
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do?

1024
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,145
You can leave me to make
a fool of myself...

1025
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:10,938
alone,

1026
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,731
if you don't mind.

1027
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,776
It's hard to imagine you
making a fool of yourself.

1028
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,403
Well, I do frequently.

1029
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,239
Isn't that what I was doing
this afternoon?

1030
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,492
I had rather admired what you did
this afternoon, Miss Elizabeth.

1031
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,911
Your resentment of what
you believe to be an injustice

1032
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,830
showed courage and loyalty.

1033
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,249
I could wish that
I might possess a friend

1034
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,293
who would defend me as ably as
Mr. Wickham was defended today.

1035
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,297
You're very puzzling, Mr. Darcy.

1036
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:42,344
At this moment, it's difficult
to believe that you're so... proud.

1037
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,807
At this moment, it's difficult to believe
that you are so prejudiced.

1038
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,729
Shall we not call quits
and start again?

1039
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,900
Oh, Lizzy,
Mr. Bingley Is going to arrange

1040
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,402
a Highland Reel for us.
Come along.

1041
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,653
Yes, please do.

1042
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,615
Shall we?

1043
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,788
I must insist that you look
at Jane and Mr. Bingley.

1044
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,666
The dear boy makes
no secret of his admiration.

1045
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,626
And the week she was "I
here at Netherfield

1046
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,295
completed the conquest.

1047
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,755
I knew it would.

1048
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,716
Wasn't it clever of me
to send her over in the rain?

1049
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,593
And of course,
dear Jane will see

1050
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,178
that the other girls have
an opportunity

1051
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,264
of meeting all sorts of
rich young men. Mm.

1052
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,518
I told you not to drink
so much punch, Kitty.

1053
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,103
You know,
you're quite tipsy.

1054
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,104
I am not.

1055
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,482
Hold it! Hold up.

1056
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:38,400
Stupid step.

1057
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,944
Hello, Lizzy. Hello, Mr. Darcy.

1058
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,781
Look at Kitty.
She's drunk as a lord.

1059
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,282
I am not.

1060
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,830
Ladies and gentlemen,

1061
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,499
if you will choose your partners,

1062
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,792
we'll all have a Highland Reel.

1063
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,590
Such a gay dance, the reel.

1064
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,802
Won't you allow me to take you in?

1065
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,678
I'm sure there must be many young men

1066
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,680
who are eager to dance it with you.

1067
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,810
Ah, Miss Elizabeth, do you recall?
The first dance?

1068
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,313
Ah, sir, will you please accept
the humble apology

1069
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,190
of one who's only just learned
you are the nephew

1070
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,901
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh?

1071
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,237
- Indeed.
- You will be happy to learn

1072
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,696
that when I left her
two weeks ago,

1073
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,407
your gracious aunt was
enjoying the best of health.

1074
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,584
What graciousness.
What condescension.

1075
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,044
What snobbery.

1076
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,881
Miss Eliza,
please remember that Mr. Darcy

1077
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,800
is the nephew
of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

1078
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,385
I do, Mr. Collins.

1079
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,887
I also remember that Mr. Darcy
is the sort of person

1080
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,347
who offers his friendship...

1081
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,017
and then at the first test
of loyalty, withdraws it.

1082
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,812
Shall we go inside?

1083
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:57,938
Of course.

1084
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,058
♪♪

1085
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,866
Kitty, would you stop moving about?

1086
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,174
Oh, little fellow,
please don't cry.

1087
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,600
Oh, there's Lizzy.

1088
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,898
Lizzy. Lizzy.

1089
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,775
Come and see how pretty this is.

1090
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,072
Oh, that's charming, Kitty.

1091
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,782
What a pity
you didn't make it bigger.

1092
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,367
We could have put it 'round Mr. Collins

1093
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,952
when he grows
too much of a bore.

1094
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,080
Lizzy, how could you speak like that
about your charming cousin?

1095
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,748
- Oh, but he's--
- There you are, Mrs. Bennet.

1096
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,793
Oh! Oh, Mr. Collins,
we were just talking about you.

1097
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,337
I thought you were walking
with Jane, Mr. Collins.

1098
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,755
I left Miss Jane in the garden

1099
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,298
with Miss Charlotte
and the new puppies.

1100
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:49,675
I think I'll join them.

1101
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,093
One moment please,
Miss Elizabeth.

1102
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,387
Uh, madam,
may I have the permission

1103
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,764
to solicit a private interview
with your daughter, Elizabeth?

1104
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:56,765
Private?

1105
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:58,976
Well, I, uh, really--

1106
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,936
Uh, yes, indeed.

1107
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,480
Lizzy will be only too happy.

1108
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,651
Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.

1109
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,486
Why do you keep winking, Mama?

1110
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,237
Winking?

1111
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,406
Why, I wasn't winking.

1112
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,407
But you were, Mama.

1113
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,784
Don't contradict. Come, Kitty.

1114
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,537
But Mr. Collins could have
nothing private to say to me.

1115
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:19,663
No nonsense, Lizzy.

1116
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,416
Lizzy, I desire you
to stay where you are.

1117
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,500
Come, Kitty.

1118
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,419
Mr. Collins.

1119
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,171
Come along, Kitty.

1120
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,222
Believe me,
my dear Miss Elizabeth,

1121
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,808
your modesty does you
no disservice in my eyes.

1122
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,602
Oh, wait. You can hardly doubt
the purport of my discourse.

1123
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,980
My intentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

1124
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,774
I have singled you out

1125
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,776
as the companion
of my future life.

1126
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,362
Oh, please,
before my feelings run away with me,

1127
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,197
let me state my reasons for marrying.

1128
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,451
First, I regard it as the duty
of every gentleman

1129
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,161
in easy circumstances
to marry.

1130
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,872
Secondly, I'm convinced it will
add greatly to my happiness.

1131
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,790
And thirdly,
I think it only right

1132
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,876
that since I am to inherit
your father's estate,

1133
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,586
I should try and
keep it in the family.

1134
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,713
And fourthly,
it is the particular wish

1135
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,006
of that very noble lady

1136
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,841
whom I have the honor
to call my patroness,

1137
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,634
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

1138
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,971
These, dear Miss Elizabeth,
are my motives.

1139
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,557
And now, nothing remains
but to me to assure you

1140
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,267
of the violence of my affection.

1141
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,519
Why, you are too hasty, sir.

1142
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,855
You forget that
I have made no answer.

1143
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,149
Let me do so at once.

1144
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,070
I appreciate the honor of your proposal.

1145
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,821
Oh, my dear Miss Elizabeth.

1146
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,531
But I must decline with thanks.

1147
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,200
I understand,
my dear Miss Elizabeth,

1148
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,826
that it is a delicate
and charming custom

1149
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,661
of young ladies to say no
when they mean yes,

1150
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,205
even to three and four refusals.

1151
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,790
I am therefore
by no means discouraged

1152
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,374
- by what you have said.
- Upon my word, sir,

1153
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,667
you are very hard to discourage.

1154
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,960
- Ah, my dear--
- Mr. Collins,

1155
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,338
you have made your offer.
I have refused it.

1156
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,548
You can therefore take
possession of this estate

1157
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,051
without the least compunction
or self-reproach

1158
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,677
whenever it falls to you.

1159
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,430
So let's regard the incident as closed.

1160
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,556
But, my dear Miss Elizabeth,

1161
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,100
I think you ought to take
into consideration

1162
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,477
that in spite of your loveliness
and amiable qualifications,

1163
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,105
you are practically penniless.
And it is by no means certain

1164
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,107
that another offer of marriage
may ever be made you.

1165
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,024
Well, by all--

1166
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,318
So I must therefore
attribute your refusal of me

1167
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,320
to your wish of increasing
my love by suspense.

1168
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:16,822
Which is, I am told,

1169
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,907
the usual practice
of elegant females.

1170
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,035
Believe me, sir, I am not
one of those elegant females

1171
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,496
who takes pleasure
in tormenting a respectable man.

1172
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,289
I am a rational creature,

1173
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,916
speaking the truth
from her heart.

1174
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,252
Ah, thank you.
You make me feel certain

1175
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,545
that when my proposal is sanctioned

1176
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,879
by the authority of your parents,

1177
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,048
- you will plainly say yes.
- Oh!

1178
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,097
Oh, Papa.

1179
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:43,056
- What is it?
- Lizzy!

1180
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,100
Oh, Papa, dear, I must tell you.

1181
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,226
Come in the library.

1182
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,145
Lizzy, what--?

1183
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,396
Oh.

1184
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,614
Oh, my dear future son-in-law.

1185
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,867
Let me be the first to wish you joy.

1186
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:02,742
Thank you, madam.

1187
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,786
Indeed, I trust I have
every reason for joy.

1188
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,746
Of course,
I know that my cousin's refusal

1189
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,082
naturally springs
from her bashful modesty.

1190
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,000
Refusal?

1191
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,878
With Lizzy, that does not mean
bashful modesty.

1192
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,337
But never mind, Mr. Collins.

1193
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,964
She's a very foolish, headstrong girl

1194
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,257
and does not know her own interest.

1195
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,010
Foolish? Headstrong? Dear me.

1196
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,512
Those failings will not make her
a very desirable wife.

1197
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,472
Oh, but you quite misunderstand,
Mr. Collins.

1198
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,058
Lizzy is only headstrong
in matters such as these.

1199
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,810
Uh--you just wait, Mr. Collins.

1200
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,770
Mr. Bennet always brings her to reason.

1201
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,983
Headstrong? Foolish? Dear me.

1202
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,110
Lady Catherine will never approve.

1203
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,823
Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet,
we are all in an uproar.

1204
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,075
Lizzy has refused to marry Mr. Collins.

1205
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,578
You must force her
to change her mind immediately,

1206
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,496
or he'll change his and not have her.

1207
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,497
In which event, my dear,

1208
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,708
the matter will be settled
at a satisfaction of both.

1209
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,084
Please be serious.
Speak to her.

1210
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,712
Tell her you insist upon her marrying him.

1211
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,340
- Lizzy.
- Yes, Papa?

1212
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,508
Your mother insists
that you accept Mr. Collins.

1213
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,509
Isn't that 50, Mrs. Bennet?

1214
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,762
Or else I shall never see her again.

1215
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,598
An unhappy alternative
is before you, Elizabeth.

1216
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,642
Your mother will never see you again

1217
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,852
if you do not marry Mr. Collins.

1218
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,813
And I will never see you again if you do.

1219
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:15,649
Dear Papa.

1220
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,070
♪♪

1221
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,826
But, Mama,
you've no right to open Jane's letter.

1222
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,246
It's against the principles
of Magna Carta.

1223
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,581
No right to open
my own daughter's letters?

1224
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,625
I--I never heard of such a thing.

1225
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,877
Besides, dear Jane need never know.

1226
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:38,797
Oh, I'm sure it's the proposal.

1227
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,299
I can feel it in my bones.

1228
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,510
"My dearest Jane..."

1229
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,265
Oh.

1230
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,183
Oh!

1231
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,770
She's lost him.
She's lost him!

1232
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,815
We've lost two of them!

1233
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,233
What's lost, Mama?

1234
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,526
Your husbands.

1235
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,945
You've thrown away Mr. Collins,

1236
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,989
and now here's Jane losing Mr. Bingley.

1237
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,573
Well, what are you talking about, Mama?

1238
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:06,700
Read that.

1239
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,034
No, no, it belongs to Jane.

1240
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,703
I--I thought it was a declaration,

1241
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,704
so I opened it.

1242
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,998
They've gone.
They've gone to London.

1243
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,416
Well, who's gone to London?

1244
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,585
Mr. Bingley, his sister, and Mr. Darcy.

1245
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,714
They've packed up and
left without even saying goodbye.

1246
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:21,673
Read it.

1247
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,967
Read what Miss Bingley has to say.

1248
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,052
Lizzy.

1249
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,725
Well, nobody's going to miss that high
and mighty Mr. Darcy.

1250
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,768
Oh, do be quiet, Lydia.

1251
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,146
Without a sign of a proposal.

1252
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,107
After his compromising attentions to Jane.

1253
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,651
Mama, he did not compromise Jane.

1254
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,279
He is a very undeserving young man.

1255
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,115
My only comfort is
she'll die of a broken heart.

1256
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,450
Then he'll be sorry.

1257
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:51,911
Mr. Wickham.

1258
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,079
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Wickham?

1259
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,080
You'll excuse me, won't you?

1260
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,999
I'm much too upset
to talk to anyone.

1261
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,125
Lizzy will give you tea.

1262
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,044
Oh, I'm sorry
you're disturbed, madam.

1263
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,628
My visit is ill-timed, I'm afraid.

1264
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,047
No, no. Mama has just heard

1265
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,257
some rather surprising news,
that's all.

1266
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,759
She'll be herself again directly.

1267
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,219
I heard some surprising news
myself this morning.

1268
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,596
- Really?
- Yes.

1269
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:11,389
But it was good news.

1270
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,390
Yes?

1271
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,975
Good news, indeed.

1272
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:15,810
Well?

1273
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,520
Mr. Darcy has left Netherfield.

1274
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,733
So I hear.

1275
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,445
Well, uh, don't you want
to know why he went?

1276
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,031
I should like very much to know.

1277
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,533
His conscience drove him away,
Miss Elizabeth.

1278
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,328
You mean he was ashamed of
his behavior at the Assembly Ball.

1279
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,496
Oh, that was nothing.

1280
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:35,830
Thank you.

1281
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:40,043
Merely the insult Mr. Darcy
likes to add to injury.

1282
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:45,340
Miss Elizabeth, having confided
so much of my story to you,

1283
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,008
I'd like you to understand the rest.

1284
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:48,593
Would it bore you?

1285
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,179
Oh, no. On the contrary. I--

1286
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,430
I am deeply interested.

1287
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,558
How kind and sympathetic you are.

1288
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,560
Would it surprise you to learn

1289
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,854
that I was once intended
for the church, Miss Elizabeth?

1290
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,982
Really? Well, you seem
so well-fitted for the army.

1291
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,193
I have no taste for soldiering.

1292
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,404
The church ought to
have been my profession,

1293
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:08,571
and would have been,

1294
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,783
if Mr. Darcy hadn't chosen
to disregard his father's will.

1295
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,285
Disregard a will?
Well, how could he?

1296
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,621
For a man of honor,
it would have been impossible.

1297
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,124
But Darcy chose to regard the annuity

1298
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,751
which his father left me,
provided I entered the church,

1299
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,337
as a mere recommendation
and not a bequest.

1300
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:29,092
I knew Mr. Darcy was...
proud and arrogant.

1301
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,470
I never imagined him dishonorable.

1302
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,476
He should be publicly exposed.

1303
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,811
Not by me, Miss Elizabeth.

1304
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,271
While I remember the father,

1305
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,314
I could never bring myself
to disgrace the son.

1306
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,900
I admire your generosity, Mr. Wickham.

1307
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:47,777
Thank you, Miss Elizabeth.

1308
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,697
Your sympathy means very much to me.

1309
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,410
Oh, there you are.

1310
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,828
We can't let you keep him, Lizzy.

1311
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,413
He's got to come and play with us.

1312
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,206
You're going to be my partner,
Mr. Wickham.

1313
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,916
What an honor.
I've been kidnapped.

1314
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,418
- Won't you join us, Miss Elizabeth?
- Come on.

1315
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,961
No thanks, Mr. Denny.
Later perhaps.

1316
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,088
Come along. Gee up.

1317
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,385
♪♪

1318
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,351
Why, Jane.

1319
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,269
Oh, Lizzy.

1320
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:23,271
If you've let that
Caroline Bingley make you cry,

1321
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,148
I'll--I'll shake you.

1322
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,399
She says none of them intend

1323
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,193
to return to Netherfield this winter.

1324
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,070
She means she intends
none of them to return.

1325
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,906
Oh, Lizzy, how can you think that?

1326
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,657
After all, he's his own master.

1327
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,619
Look. Read this part.

1328
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,374
"My brother has long had
an affectionate interest

1329
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,920
in Mr. Darcy's sister, Georgiana.

1330
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,507
And during the next few months
In London,

1331
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,092
both families are hoping
that their attachment

1332
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,136
will flower into an event

1333
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,223
which will secure
the happiness of us all."

1334
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:01,643
You see? She knows her brother's
fond of someone else and

1335
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,103
doesn't want me
to have any false hope.

1336
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,149
She knows her brother's
in love with you.

1337
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,819
She doesn't intend that
he shall marry into a family...

1338
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,155
of such low descent.

1339
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,951
Lizzy, what are you talking about?

1340
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,495
Oh, never mind.

1341
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,540
You'll see, dearest.
He'll come back to you.

1342
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,084
Who could stay away from you for long?

1343
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,085
Dearest.

1344
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,671
Now come along down with me
and we'll have some tea.

1345
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:30,672
All right.

1346
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,467
Lizzy, are you really as indifferent

1347
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,511
to Mr. Darcy's departure as you seem?

1348
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,180
Indifferent?
I am delighted he's gone.

1349
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,723
Wait till I tell you the monstrous thing

1350
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,766
he did to Mr. Wickham.

1351
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,351
It's absurd, Sir William.

1352
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,270
I shall never believe it. Never.

1353
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,397
Mr. Collins came here expressly

1354
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,732
to propose marriage
to one of my daughters.

1355
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,861
That may have been his purpose
in coming here, Mrs. Bennet, uh--oh, but--

1356
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,697
Oh, there you are, Elizabeth.

1357
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,532
This is all your fault.

1358
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:58,950
What's my fault, Mama?

1359
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,244
He says Charlotte is going
to marry Mr. Collins.

1360
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,329
If that isn't your fault,
I don't know whose it is.

1361
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,455
Charlotte?

1362
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,458
- How delightful, Sir William.
- Thank you, Miss Jane.

1363
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,252
But Charlotte...

1364
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,671
Charlotte's going to marry Mr. Collins?

1365
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,256
On Tuesday, week, to be precise.

1366
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,841
Uh, Lady, uh, Catherine de Bourgh

1367
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,051
doesn't believe
in long engagements, and--

1368
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,177
But, Sir William,

1369
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,221
Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy.

1370
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,931
Oh, Lydia, be quiet.

1371
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,349
The child is right, Lizzy.

1372
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,561
Are you quite sure, Sir William,
that you haven't been misinformed?

1373
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,730
I am quite positive, Mrs. Bennet. Um--

1374
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:29,647
Mrs. Bennet.

1375
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:30,565
Oh, there you are.

1376
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,817
Come in and share in the rejoicing.

1377
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,320
Oh, dear Mrs. Bennet,
I know you'll understand my feelings.

1378
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:36,654
Such a happy event.

1379
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,032
But then to lose one's dearest daughter,

1380
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,409
oh, well, I'm still quite overcome.

1381
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,911
It's probably the unexpectedness of it

1382
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,747
that has overcome you, Lady Lucas.

1383
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,083
And Mr. Collins' conduct is so very odd.

1384
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,793
Perhaps some tea will revive you.

1385
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,214
Lizzy.

1386
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,799
Dear Charlotte, I--

1387
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,345
Come with me.

1388
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,512
Well, Lady Lucas,

1389
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,264
little did I think that Charlotte

1390
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,142
would one day take my place
as mistress of this house.

1391
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,896
No doubt she and Mr. Collins would like to
go over the place thoroughly

1392
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,564
and see what they're
going to inherit.

1393
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,734
Mr. Collins,
why don't you go to the pantry

1394
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:17,028
and get the maid to show you the silver.

1395
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,113
Oh, Charlotte, dear, I beg you,

1396
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:20,948
postpone the marriage for a time.

1397
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,659
I'm only thinking of your happiness.

1398
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,035
Happiness, Lizzy?

1399
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,205
In marriage,
happiness Is just a matter of chance.

1400
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:31,167
But, Charlotte,
his defects of character.

1401
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,086
You know him so little.

1402
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,213
Well, ignorance is bliss, Lizzy.

1403
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,131
If one's to spend one's life
with a person,

1404
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,801
it's best to know as little
as possible of his defects.

1405
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,679
After all,
one will find them out soon enough.

1406
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,308
Well, luckily Hunsford
isn't the end of the world.

1407
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:50,103
You must come and visit me,
Lizzy, very soon. Promise.

1408
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,896
- I promise.
- Good.

1409
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:55,525
♪♪

1410
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,863
Put those over here, Patrick.

1411
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,823
Yes, madam.

1412
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,034
Those will go on the chair, Nellie.

1413
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,330
Big one against the wall,
small one there. That's fine.

1414
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,958
- That will be all, Nellie.
- Thank you, miss.

1415
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,544
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

1416
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:15,670
You're welcome, miss.

1417
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,714
Now, Lizzy, give me your key.

1418
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,674
Don't you bother, Charlotte.
I'll do this myself.

1419
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,843
Oh, you'll not. You're my guest.

1420
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,636
You're going to sit by and look on.

1421
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,179
But, Charlotte--

1422
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,141
This is my house,
and you'll do just as I say.

1423
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,101
I tremble and obey.

1424
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,437
Well, while you're unpacking,

1425
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,814
I'll remove the dust
and change my dress.

1426
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,315
Did you have a hard time

1427
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,067
persuading your mother
to let you come?

1428
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,611
Oh, no. No, it wasn't so difficult.

1429
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,698
Jane went to London, you know,
to stay with Aunt Gardiner.

1430
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,367
So of course she had to have
somebody to go with her.

1431
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,537
And Papa--
Papa had some writing to do.

1432
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,915
So he was quite delighted to get
a couple of us out of the house.

1433
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,543
Two daughters out of five.

1434
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,463
That represents 40 percent of the noise.

1435
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,716
Why, Lizzy, this is daring.

1436
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,384
Yes, isn't it?

1437
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:04,927
I haven't dared show it to Mama.

1438
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:12,477
Mr. Collins!

1439
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:13,853
Mr. Collins!

1440
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:14,979
Oh, Lizzy, do look.

1441
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,063
Mr. Collins.

1442
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,031
Well, what?

1443
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,742
It's Lady Catherine de Bourgh
and her daughter, Anne.

1444
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,702
Oh, is that all?

1445
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,829
I expected at least the pigs
had gone into the garden.

1446
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,040
Oh, pigs.
I must go down at once.

1447
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,125
Oh, is my hair tidy?

1448
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,337
So that's the great Lady Catherine.

1449
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,048
Now I see where
he learned his manners.

1450
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,466
Where who learned his manners?

1451
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,259
Well, Mr. Darcy, of course.

1452
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:46,969
I'll be back in a moment, my dear.

1453
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,143
Yes, yes, Mr. Collins. Proceed.

1454
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,102
Your ladyship.

1455
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,938
- How do you do, Mrs. Collins?
- Miss de Bourgh.

1456
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,147
How do you do?

1457
01:11:58,940 --> 01:11:59,774
Now, let me see, Lady Catherine.

1458
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,943
Uh, a flannel petticoat for Mrs. Hodge,

1459
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,195
a quarter of pound of tea
for old Martha Spratt,

1460
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,947
and a hundredweight
of coals for the Burtons.

1461
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,782
But nothing for the Smees,
do you understand?

1462
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:08,991
Nothing whatever.

1463
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,410
You must learn, Mrs. Collins,
to draw a firm line

1464
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,955
between the deserving poor
and the undeserving.

1465
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,414
What wise benevolence.

1466
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,667
Are the chickens
still laying satisfactorily?

1467
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,877
They've fallen off a little
these last days.

1468
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,754
Then give them hot food,
Mrs. Collins.

1469
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:25,049
If that has no effect,
then it means they're incorrigible.

1470
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,134
They must be killed and boiled.
Killed and boiled.

1471
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,179
Anne, my love,
you're not getting cold, I hope.

1472
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,223
- A little, Mama.
- Ah...

1473
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,016
Well, Mr. Collins,

1474
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,060
I shall expect you all
to dinner this evening.

1475
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,895
Goodbye, Mrs. Collins. Goodbye.

1476
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,272
Uh, permit me to say
how much I appreciate--

1477
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,189
Drive on, Smith.

1478
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,733
...your ladyship's
affability and kindness.

1479
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,446
What extraordinary
condescension.

1480
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,324
I'm quite delighted of this,
for Miss Elizabeth's sake.

1481
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,996
Now, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
permit me to show you

1482
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,207
some of the priceless art
treasures of Lady Catherine's.

1483
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,002
This, one of the finest
timepieces in the country.

1484
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,089
Observe the noble proportions,
Miss Eliza.

1485
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,134
And the ornaments.
What magnificence. What taste.

1486
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,678
Very true, Mr. Collins.
Very true.

1487
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,639
I've never met a painter or an architect

1488
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,309
who did not congratulate me
upon my taste.

1489
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,644
There. What did I say?

1490
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,772
And now, let me call your
attention to the mantelpiece.

1491
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,443
Observe, Miss Eliza,

1492
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,987
solid marble entirely hand-carved.

1493
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,032
Well, Mrs. Collins,
you will be surprised

1494
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,783
to find someone you know
dining with us this evening.

1495
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,247
Oh, there you are.

1496
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,416
I was just about to tell the ladles,
Darcy,

1497
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,710
of your sudden arrival
at Rosings this afternoon.

1498
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:48,591
Mr. Darcy.

1499
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:49,967
Miss Elizabeth.

1500
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,262
A happy meeting, Miss Elizabeth.

1501
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,395
Mrs. Collins, you know
one of my nephews, I believe.

1502
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,773
Darcy. Darcy.

1503
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,651
A pleasure, Mrs. Collins.

1504
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,777
And this is another nephew.

1505
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,487
Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mrs. Collins.

1506
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,280
Miss Elizabeth Bennet,

1507
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,531
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

1508
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,410
A--oh, yes, and Mr. Collins.
Mr. Collins.

1509
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,286
How do you do?

1510
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,081
I thought you were In London,
Mr. Darcy.

1511
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:23,626
Oh, yes. But, uh, my cousin
and I left there this morning.

1512
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,836
Rather unexpectedly,
as a matter of fact.

1513
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,048
All your departures seem to be
rather unexpected, Mr. Darcy.

1514
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,429
You know, Miss Elizabeth,
I have thought a great deal

1515
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,431
of what you said to me
at Netherfield that day.

1516
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,558
Thank you.
About laughing more.

1517
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:41,435
I've tried to follow your advice.

1518
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,438
I hope it worked.
Do you feel happier now?

1519
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,191
I've never felt
more miserable in my life.

1520
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,736
Oh, it's doubtless
the lack of exercise.

1521
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,822
You'll feel happier when
the hunting season begins.

1522
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,116
Well, Darcy.

1523
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,119
Now I know what took you
into Herefordshire this summer.

1524
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,162
You also know what
drove him out again.

1525
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,581
He liked the landscape
well enough, but the natives,

1526
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,667
Colonel Fitzwilliam, the natives.

1527
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:08,337
What boors. What savages.
Utterly insupportable.

1528
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,089
Isn't that so, Mr. Darcy?

1529
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,258
It evidently amuses you
to think so, Miss Elizabeth.

1530
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:13,676
Miss Bennet.

1531
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,428
Come here.

1532
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,641
Mrs. Collins,
go and talk to your husband.

1533
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:21,976
I wish to speak to Miss Bennet.

1534
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,227
Yes, Lady Catherine.

1535
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:25,438
Be seated.

1536
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,359
Have you any accomplishments,
Miss Bennet?

1537
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,652
Accomplishments.

1538
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:35,364
Well, I don't know whether
Mr. Darcy would think I had.

1539
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,907
Do you sing and play?

1540
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:37,825
A little.

1541
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,702
You should perform for us one day.

1542
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,246
Our instrument here
is one of the best in the country.

1543
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,957
You have several sisters, I understand.

1544
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,293
- Four.
- Four. No brothers?

1545
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,211
None, unfortunately for us.

1546
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,379
Ah, yes.

1547
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,215
Your father's estate is entailed
to Mr. Collins, I believe.

1548
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,133
It is.

1549
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,052
For Mrs. Collins' sake, I'm glad of it.

1550
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,929
Otherwise, I see no occasion
for entailing estates

1551
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,848
away from the female line.

1552
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,267
When you marry, Darcy,

1553
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,019
don't make that mistake.

1554
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,147
It was never made
in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.

1555
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:12,109
Anne, as you know, is the sole heiress.

1556
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:16,822
Do you draw, Miss Bennet?

1557
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,407
No, Lady Catherine.

1558
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,534
What? None of you?

1559
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:21,535
Not one of us.

1560
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:22,953
But how strange.

1561
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:24,997
Why didn't your governess see to that?

1562
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,540
We never had a governess.

1563
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,334
No governess?

1564
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,627
I never heard of such a thing.

1565
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,837
Miss Bennet seems to have got on

1566
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,214
very well without one,
Aunt Catherine.

1567
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,132
Don't talk nonsense, Darcy.

1568
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,385
Are any of your younger sisters
out in society?

1569
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:39,428
All of them.

1570
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:40,846
All?

1571
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,057
How very odd.

1572
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,767
Really, Lady Catherine,

1573
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,811
I think it would be
very hard on younger sisters

1574
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:48,687
to be kept without
society or amusement

1575
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,147
until the elder ones were married.

1576
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:52,858
It would hardly promote
sisterly affection

1577
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,860
or even delicacy of mind.

1578
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,530
Upon my word, Miss Bennet.

1579
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,241
You express your opinions
very decidedly.

1580
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,743
Miss Bennet is nothing
if not decided, Aunt Catherine.

1581
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,081
Dinner is served, milady.

1582
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,500
Come, I hate cold soup.

1583
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,793
Your arm, Fitzwilliam.

1584
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,589
May I be allowed to continue
your interrogation during dinner?

1585
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,591
There are so many things
I should like to find out.

1586
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,260
It seems to be a family failing, sir.

1587
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,762
No, Darcy.
You are to take Anne into dinner.

1588
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,223
Mr. Collins will take
Miss Bennet.

1589
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,893
I'm afraid you'll have to
go in alone, Mrs. Collins.

1590
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:31,564
♪♪

1591
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:13,189
Mr. Darcy's sister, Georgiana,
is a very accomplished musician.

1592
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,484
And I too should have been
a great proficient,

1593
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:19,153
if I'd ever learnt.

1594
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,031
You would have been proficient
at anything, Lady Catherine.

1595
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:23,324
So would Anne.

1596
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:24,950
That goes without saying.

1597
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,377
Darcy?

1598
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:37,630
Do come here.

1599
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,681
Sit down, sit down.

1600
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,187
I was just telling Mrs. Collins

1601
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,773
how exquisitely dear Anne
would have played...

1602
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,567
if her health
had permitted her to study.

1603
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:00,361
I don't doubt it.

1604
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,655
Your dear mother
was so fond of Anne.

1605
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,114
Yes, I know.

1606
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,700
"You have an only daughter,"
she used to say to me.

1607
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:08,911
"And I have an only son.

1608
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,207
It's as though Providence had
created them for one another,"

1609
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:14,750
she used to say.

1610
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,046
Incredible.
I-I mean, uh, exactly.

1611
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:22,841
I--I mean, uh, excuse me.

1612
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,363
Well, don't stop, Miss Elizabeth,
that was charming.

1613
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:47,283
Isn't that the right time to stop?
When people still think you're charming?

1614
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,493
If I went on,
you might change your mind.

1615
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,041
Miss Bennet.

1616
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,006
I'm summoned.

1617
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,302
That was quite creditable, my dear.

1618
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,554
Miss Bennet wouldn't
play at all badly,

1619
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:09,930
if she practiced more.

1620
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,100
Practice, Miss Bennet, practice.
You can't do enough of it.

1621
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,437
Mrs. Collins has no pianoforte, of course,

1622
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,230
but you're...
you're very welcome

1623
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,648
to practice here every day.

1624
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,318
Oh, thank you, Lady Catherine.

1625
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,446
There's a very fair instrument
in the housekeeper's room.

1626
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,406
You'll disturb no one there.

1627
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,243
You are really too gracious,
Lady Catherine,

1628
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,621
but I shouldn't care
to disturb the housekeeper.

1629
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,915
I protest, Aunt Catherine.

1630
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,168
Why talk of practicing
when Miss Bennet should be playing?

1631
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,294
Come, Miss Bennet.

1632
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,171
I insist on your favoring us again.

1633
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:52,014
There is, uh, needless to say,
a rich assortment of music here.

1634
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,641
My aunt means quite kindly,
Miss Elizabeth.

1635
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,477
Her manner is sometimes
a little unfortunate.

1636
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:57,978
Having already met you,

1637
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,773
I was happily prepared
for your aunt's manner.

1638
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,325
Lizzy, Mr. Darcy's in the study.

1639
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:12,993
He's been waiting
for you for nearly an hour.

1640
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,246
Let him wait.
I don't want to see him.

1641
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,165
I never want to see him again.

1642
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:20,000
Well, Lizzy, what's happened?
What's come over you?

1643
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:21,919
Do you want to know the real reason

1644
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:23,796
why Mr. Bingley
left Netherfield for London?

1645
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,091
His high-and-mightiness, Mr. Darcy.

1646
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,592
But I thought it was Caroline Bingley.

1647
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:29,843
She was only half the reason.

1648
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:31,220
I've just heard about it by chance

1649
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,013
this very moment from Colonel Fitzwilliam.

1650
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:34,431
Colonel Fitzwilliam?

1651
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,183
Of course he didn't know
I was Jane's sister.

1652
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:39,645
He was just holding forth about
the virtues of his precious cousin.

1653
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:41,522
Telling me how unselfish he was

1654
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,732
and what an infinite amount
of trouble he'd gone to

1655
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,527
to save his friend Bingley
from an impossible marriage.

1656
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:47,361
Oh...

1657
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,863
You can tell your Mr. Darcy
that I'm not at home.

1658
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,824
He must have seen you come in.
I can't tell him that.

1659
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,118
After all, he is Lady Catherine's nephew.

1660
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:57,454
Lizzy, for my sake.

1661
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,249
Very well, Charlotte, for your sake.

1662
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:14,221
Good morning, Miss Elizabeth.

1663
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,889
Good morning, Mr. Darcy.

1664
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,316
Mrs. Collins gave me leave
to wait on you.

1665
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:41,957
It's no use.

1666
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,126
I've struggled in vain.

1667
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,503
I must tell you how much

1668
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:48,297
I admire and love you.

1669
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:49,882
Miss Elizabeth,

1670
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,759
my life and happiness
are in your hands.

1671
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,262
These last weeks
since I left Netherfield

1672
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,556
have been empty,
meaningless days and nights.

1673
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,726
I thought I could put you
out of my mind.

1674
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,437
That inclination would
give way to judgment.

1675
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,148
I walked the streets of London,

1676
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,025
reminding myself of the unsuitability

1677
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:09,151
of such a marriage.

1678
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,653
Of the obstacles between us.

1679
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:14,198
But it won't do.

1680
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,159
I can struggle against you no longer.

1681
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,785
Mr. Darcy.

1682
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,287
I've reminded myself again and again

1683
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,456
that I have obligations
of family and position.

1684
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:26,502
Obligations I was born to.
Nothing I tell myself matters.

1685
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,378
I love you.

1686
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:30,797
I love you.

1687
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:34,468
Do you know what you're saying?

1688
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:35,719
Yes, my darling.

1689
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:37,971
I'm asking you to marry me.

1690
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:46,647
Do you expect me to thank you

1691
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:49,066
for this extraordinary offer of marriage?

1692
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:52,361
Am I supposed to feel flattered
that you have so overcome

1693
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,112
your aversion to my family,

1694
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,572
that you're ready to marry into it?

1695
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,366
But do you expect me to be glad

1696
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:58,784
that your family is inferior to mine?

1697
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:01,828
I suppose I should congratulate you

1698
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,456
on winning the battle
between your unwilling affection

1699
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:06,542
and my unworthiness.

1700
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,044
But, you see, I have never desired
your good opinion.

1701
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,171
And if you were not so lacking
in perception,

1702
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,382
you might have
spared yourself my refusal.

1703
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,385
It's--is this the only reply
I am to be honored with?

1704
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,430
I might, perhaps,
deserve to be told why I am rejected

1705
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,807
and with so little civility.

1706
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,101
I also might deserve to know why,

1707
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:26,645
determined, evidently,
to offend and insult me,

1708
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,690
you chose to tell me
that you liked me against your will.

1709
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,651
Against your reason.
Against even your character.

1710
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,653
Why, if the manner of my expression--

1711
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,447
The manner of your proposal
is only one reason for my incivility,

1712
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:38,740
if I have been uncivil.

1713
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,742
Even had my feelings been favorable--

1714
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:41,827
which they never could have been,

1715
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:44,121
but even if they had,
I still have every reason in the world

1716
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:45,163
to think I" of you.

1717
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,041
Do you think anything would
tempt me to accept the man

1718
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,586
who has destroyed
the happiness of my sister?

1719
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,423
The sweetest soul that ever lived.

1720
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,634
How could you do it?

1721
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,722
Knowing Jane,
how could you hurt her so?

1722
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:02,848
In observing them together,

1723
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,017
I could not believe
that she really loved Charles.

1724
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,520
As his friend I considered it
my duty to advise his cause.

1725
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,147
And even without this,

1726
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:11,982
your character was clearly revealed

1727
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,275
in your treatment of Mr. Wickham.

1728
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,444
You take an eager interest
in that gentleman's concern.

1729
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,821
And who that knows his misfortunes

1733

I have nothing to say.

1734
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,498
In other words,
you dare not speak

1735
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,833
because you know you're guilty.

1736
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,502
And that is your opinion of me.

1737
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,674
Perhaps my faults might
have been overlooked

1738
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,718

1739
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,553

that no doubt of my course

1740
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,888
had ever entered my mind.

1741
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,474
I made the mistake
of being honest with you.

1742
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,976
Honesty is a greatly overrated virtue.

1743
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,062
Silence in this case
would have been more agreeable.

But I'm not ashamed of
my scruples about your family.

1745
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:52,939
They were natural.

1746
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,067

kept to yourself.

Mrs. Bennet.

1809
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:49,616
Yours is a misfortune
which no lapse of time can alleviate.

No lapse of time, Mrs. Philips.

Distressing her?
I'm bringing her consolation.

May I add, madam,

1817
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,256
that this false step
of one of your daughters,

1818
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,049
uh, must prove very injurious

1819
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:07,759
unto the fortunes of all the others.

1820
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,053
Oh, he's right. He's right.
They'll never get married now.

Don't you see him, Lizzy.

1828
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,903
Oh, madam. 0h, don't forget
that Mr. Darcy is a nephew

1829

Bad news travels fast, Miss Bennet.

1839
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,401
A few hours after you left Hunsford,

1840
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,737
I heard about George Wickham
and your sister.

1841
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,489
I felt it my duty to come at once.

1842
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,952
To triumph over us, I suppose.

1843
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,082
To offer you my services.

1844
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,711
Miss Bennet, I told you the other day

1845
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,129
that where George Wickham
was concerned,

1846
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:27,380
I chose to be silent.

1847

What has happened to your sister
has made me change my mind.

1848
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:34,471
You have a right to the truth.

1849
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,934
George Wickham will never marry
your sister, Miss Bennet.

1850

Her case...

1851
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:44,898

1853
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,904
My own sister, Georgiana.

1854
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:52,864

1855

Yes.

1856
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,120

Oh, Mr. Darcy.

1858
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,003
Georgiana has a considerable fortune
in her own right.

1859
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,673
His plan was to elope with her,

1860
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:13,009
and then, under the threat
of publishing her disgrace,

1861
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,512
to force my consent to their marriage.

1862
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:17,722

01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:43,034
Jane, I love him.

1907
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:46,579
You love him?

1908
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,623
I'm so dreadfully unhappy.

1909
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:50,667
Lizzy, dearest.

1910
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,754
I brought it all on myself.
It's all my own stupid fault.

1911
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,550
Heavens,
how could I have misjudged him so?

1912
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:03,721
Oh, what a fool I've been.
What a despicable fool.

1913
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,057
Oh, Lizzy, dearest,
we all make mistakes.

1914
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,268
- You mustn't feel--
- Oh, and how selfish I'm being.

1915
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,436
As if I were the only one
to be made unhappy.

1916
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:12,313
Poor Jane, my darling.

1917
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,898
Why, you've never done anything wrong.

1918
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,275
Look what's happened to you.

1919
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,484
Oh.

1920
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:18,778
It's not fair.

1921
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:19,904
Oh, Lizzy.

1922
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:21,698
I'm not really unhappy.

1923
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:23,449
It was worse in the beginning

1924
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,285
when I was always
expecting him to write

1925
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:27,036
or even to come back.

1926
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:28,913
But I don't do that anymore.

1927
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:30,415
I just dream of him.

1928
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:35,128
Lizzy, you've got to learn
to dream, like I do.

1929
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,756
Sometimes I dream
we're out walking in the woods,

1930
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,633
and the primroses are out.

1931
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:43,136
Sometimes he comes riding up to the door.

1932
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,555
Riding on a white horse, Lizzy.

1933
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,683
And he goes in,
and I'm waiting for him.

1934
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,019
And sometimes we're dancing.

1935
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:52,562
And it's the waltz, Lizzy.

1936
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:55,732
And the music's playing,
and lights are shining.

1937
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,567
Oh, it feels as if it could go on forever.

1938
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,404
Oh, Lizzy,
you shouldn't let me go on like this.

1939
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,044
Oh, well done, Mr. Darcy.

1940
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:19,464
The question is, what to do now?

1941
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,011
Ah.

1942
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:27,555
More news from Meryton.

1943
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,433
Another bulletin about
your beloved Bennets, Charles.

1944
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:33,394
"There is still no trace
of Lydia or Wickham.

1945
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,064
Poor old Mr. Bennet
has come home in despair."

1946
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,440
Do you mean that they've
given up the search?

1947
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:38,858
Mm. So it seems.

1948
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:42,278
Listen.

1949
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,614
"At the Assembly Ball last week,

1950
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:47,367
the Bennet family
was conspicuous by its absence.

1951
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:48,826
Shall I tell you why?

1952
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:52,038
Because the Entertainment Committee
had dropped a gentle hint

1953
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:53,790
that, in view of the scandal,

1954
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:55,875
its presence would not be welcome."

1955
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,212
Isn't that exquisitely funny, Mr. Darcy?

1956
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:00,338
Exquisitely.

1957
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:03,216
Just think how you would roar
with laughter if it happened to yourself.

1958
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:08,137
"Only yesterday, I saw her sisters, Jane
and Elizabeth,

1959
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:11,516
almost running down Market Street,
in an attempt to escape

1960
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:12,600
from their disgrace."

1961
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:18,439
That's what comes
of your chattering, Caroline.

1962
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,316
I'm sorry, Darcy.

1963
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,235
I've ruined your table, I'm afraid.

1964
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,279
It's nothing, Charles.
It might have happened

1965
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,863
to anybody in the same circumstances.

1966
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:27,323
I'd better stop playing

1967
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:28,950
before something worse happens.

1968
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,451
- Goodnight, Darcy.
- Goodnight.

1969
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:31,744
Goodnight, Caroline.

1970
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:42,880
I don't believe I shall ever
get back my strength.

1971
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:45,216
It won't be long now, Mama.

1972
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:46,592
You'll feel so much better

1973
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:48,344
when we've moved away
from this place.

1974
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:49,429
Won't she, Papa?

1975
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:50,888
Well, I sincerely hope so.

1976
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,391
This house with its sad associations

1977
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,768
and now the people
being so dreadfully unkind.

1978
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:57,729
It's no wonder you're ill.

1979
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,814
Here's some delicious chicken broth, Mama.

1980
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:01,607
Now, you must eat it while it's hot.

1981
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:04,152
No. No, thank you, Lizzy, I couldn't.

1982
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,447
You don't know how “I I feel.

1983
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:10,575
Did you say it was chicken broth?

1984
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:13,244
Well... well, perhaps...

1985
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,496
if I make a great effort.

1986
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,290
Ah, there, Mama.

1987
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:18,750
There.

1988
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,504
Papa, what was that you were saying

1989
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,340
about those nice cheap lodgings

1990
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:26,549
you heard of by the sea?

1991
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:28,384
- At “agate, my dear?
- Yes.

1992
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:29,844
Margate.

1993
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:32,513
To think that it should come to Margate.

1994
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:35,433
No, Lizzy, I... I couldn't eat any more.

1995
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,310
Not after that.

1996
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:38,603
Oh, but Mama.

1997
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,730
Everyone says Margate's
such a charming place

1998
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,106
and so inexpensive.

1999
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:44,317
Besides, what does it matter where we go,

2000
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,110
as long as we go together?

2001
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,197
Yes, Mama.
We'll make a little world of our own.

2002
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:52,158
Yes. A Bennet utopia, my dear.

2003
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:54,285
A domestic paradise,

2004
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,247
where nobody shall ever talk
more than is strictly necessary.

2005
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:01,376
Oh, Mr. Bennet.

2006
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:06,089
Where nobody shall ever
play scales on the piano, Lizzy.

2007
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:09,425
Where nobody shall ever
even think of bonnets

2008
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,594
or tea parties or gossip or--

2009
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:12,929
Why do you have to tell Mama?

2010
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:14,180
Tell Mama. Tell them all.

2011
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:15,640
Mama!

2012
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:16,682
Oh!

2013
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:18,184
My poor nerves.

2014
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,520
Stop squabbling, you two,
for goodness' sake.

2015
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:22,939
Mary says I can't take
my musical box to the new house.

2016
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:24,023
Listen to it.

2017
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,942
It's not nearly as bad
as your horrid old bird.

2018
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:27,944
Polly is not a horrid old bird.

2019
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:30,029
And if you think that I can bear
to listen to that thing--

2020
01:38:30,196 --> 01:38:32,657
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves,
with poor Mama so ill?

2021
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:34,242
A Bennet utopia, my dear.

2022
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:35,576
But, Lizzy, it's not fair.

2023
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,371
If Mary can take her parrot,
why shouldn't I take my musical box?

2024
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,747
Well, why shouldn't we take the piano?

2025
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,707
Why shouldn't Papa take
all the books in his library?

2026
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:44,377
Why should poor Mama have to leave
her collection of china behind?

2027
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:46,421
Come along and tell Mama you're sorry.
Come on.

2028
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,174
I'm sorry, Mama.

2029
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,843
We oughtn't to have made such a fuss.

2030
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:52,927
I'm sorry.

2031
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,179
Mr. Collins.

2032
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,723
I took the liberty of coming
across the garden.

2033
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:58,766
May I be permitted?

2034
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,268
Come in, Mr. Collins. Come in.

2035
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,644
Thank you, sir, thank you.

2036
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:03,020
Oh, ladies.

2037
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,565
Miss Eliza. I, uh--

2038
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:07,900
I trust, madam,
I see you in better health.

2039
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,610
I wish you did, Mr. Collins.

2040
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:12,822
Nobody can imagine how weak I feel,

2041
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:14,615
as if I were fading away.

2042
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:17,201
Well, it's not to be wondered at
in the circumstances.

2043
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:21,372
I'm sorry to see that Mr. Bennet
also looks far from well.

2044
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:23,499
He seems to have aged a great deal

2045
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,751
in the last few weeks,
don't you think so, Miss Eliza?

2046
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,963
Does he? Perhaps the wish is
father to the thought, Mr. Collins.

2047
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:31,466
I suppose you have heard

2048
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:34,427
that we are leaving Longbourn,
Mr. Collins.

2049
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,053
A wise decision, madam.

2050
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:38,431
Find some remote and secluded spot

2051
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:40,641
where no one has ever heard
of your unhappy daughter.

2052
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,935
Oh, my poor little Lydia.

2053
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:45,271
What can have happened to her?

2054
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:48,524
- What Is It, Papa?
- 1".--

2055
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:51,152
It's from your Uncle Gardiner.

2056
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:52,904
He's found Lydia.

2057
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:54,489
- He's found her?
- Yes.

2058
01:39:57,158 --> 01:40:00,119
"...and Wickham asked for
1,000 pounds at your death

2059
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:02,413
and 100 pounds a year
during your lifetime.

2060
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:06,000
These terms seemed moderate,
and I took upon myself

2061
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:07,835
the responsibility of agreeing to them."

2062
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:09,462
He's agreed to Wickham's terms.

2063
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,548
He doesn't seem to be
asking very much, does he?

2064
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:14,800
Considering what he'd demanded when--

2065
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:18,804
I mean, considering the sort of man he is.

2066
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:22,517
Why do you think he's content
with so little, Papa?

2067
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,185
Well, this is what your uncle says.

2068
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:25,436
Here. Postscript.

2069
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,399
"It seems that Wickham recently came
into a very considerable sum of money."

2070
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,362
Oh, I see. Well... that explains it.

2071
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,572
No, it doesn't explain anything, my child.

2072
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:38,074
We know that Wickham's in debt.

2073
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:40,243
We know he's extravagant.
We know he's a gambler.

2074
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,912
And yet suddenly,
he has so much money

2075
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:45,665
that he'll take a girl like Lydia
for two pounds a week.

2076
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,126
Ah, there are two things I want to know.

2077

One is how much money your uncle
has laid down to bring this about.

The other is...

Miss Bennet,

2187
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:56,076
a report has reached me
of a most alarming nature.

2188
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:59,622
I was told that you,
Miss Elizabeth Bennet,

2189
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:03,250
were shortly to be engaged
to my nephew, Mr. Darcy.

2190
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,922
Of course, I could not believe this report
could possibly be true.

2191
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:09,340
Nevertheless,

2192
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:11,800
I immediately resolved upon
setting out to see you.

2193
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:14,011
If it could not possibly be true, madam,

2194
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:16,889
I wonder you gave yourself
the trouble of coming so far.

2195
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:22,102
I came to insist upon the report
being universally contradicted.

2196
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,439
But won't your coming here
seem rather to confirm it?

2197
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:27,900
Insolent, headstrong girl.

2198
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,693
I'm ashamed of you.

2199
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,779
Is this your gratitude

2200
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:34,031
for my attentions to you at Rosings?

2201
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:37,201
Miss Bennet, I am not to be trifled with.

2202
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:39,703
Has my nephew made you
an offer of marriage?

2203
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,664
You have declared that to be impossible.

2204
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,209
Impossible?
I have the power to make It Impossible.

2205
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:49,588
Are you aware that as trustee
of my sister's estate,

2206
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:53,342
I can strip Mr. Darcy
of every shilling he has?

2207
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:56,428
And if he were to marry
against my wishes,

2208
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:59,807
I should not hesitate
in carrying out my power.

2209
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:02,184
Now what have you to say?

2210
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:04,395
Nothing whatever.

2211
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:08,023
I take no interest in matters
that are none of my business.

2212
01:48:08,774 --> 01:48:09,525
Ahh.

2213
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,319
Bold words, my girl, bold words.

2214
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:13,946
But remember this,

2215
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:16,991
marry him and you will be poor.

2216
01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:19,576
That would be no novelty for me,
Lady Catherine.

2217
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,496
Once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

2218
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:25,582
No, I am not.

2219
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:26,959
Ah.

2220
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:29,086
And, uh, will you promise me

2221
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:31,338
never to enter
into such an engagement?

2222
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:36,135
No, I will not.

2223
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,302
Oh.

2224
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,431
So you do expect him to propose to you?

2225
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,766
I have no right to expect anything,

2226
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:44,435
excepting, perhaps,

2227
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:46,228
never to see him again.

2228
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,689
What? Do you have
the impertinence to pretend

2229
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:50,232
that he isn't in love with you?

2230
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:52,776
I can't imagine that he would be.

2231
01:48:53,277 --> 01:48:54,028
Not now.

2232
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:57,197
Then why his kind consideration
for your sister?

2233
01:48:57,489 --> 01:48:59,616
Was that the act of a man
who isn't in love?

2234
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:01,827
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2235
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:05,914
Possibly you don't.
But that rascal, Wickham, does.

2236
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:09,043
Imagine it. My nephew, Darcy,

2237
01:49:09,585 --> 01:49:13,422
scouring the courts and alleys
of London looking for him.

2238
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:16,050
Huh! Setting him up with an income.

2239
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:21,221
Forcing him to marry that silly little...
flibbertigibbet.

2240
01:49:21,764 --> 01:49:22,765
Did he do that?

2241
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:24,475
Oh.

2242
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:27,061
Thank you for telling me,
Lady Catherine.

2243

I shall not leave this house

2246
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,530
until you have given me
the assurance for which I ask.

2247
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:39,907
In that case, Lady Catherine,

2248
01:49:40,074 --> 01:49:41,533
I had better ring for the butler.

2249
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,246
He will show you to your bedroom.

2250
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,208
Or if you decide,
