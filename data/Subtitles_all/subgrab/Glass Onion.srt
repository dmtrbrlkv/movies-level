No, subject to their approval...
Ah, hold on.

00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,625
- Hey. Oh, shit, sorry. Let me, uh…
- Uh, sign here.

{\an8}Can you grab the thing?
Oh my God, it's heavy.

What's this?

00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,958
I don't know.
I've got the CNN thing in like… now.

Amy, come on. Look alive.
Hold this, please.

10
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:49,667
Okay.

11
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,750
It's from Miles!

Connecticut governor, Claire Debella,</i>

00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes. Welcome to our office,

Isn't that how he became Miles Bron?
You guys have no idea.

The man faxes me

Remember "child equals NFT"?

40
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,417
We all laughed,

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,750
but then the Crypto Kids app
paid for this building.

42
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,042
- Delivery.
- I mean, how do you argue with that?

43
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,750
- I wiped it down.
<i>- Yeah, we know.</i>

a volatile substance on a manned flight.</i>

00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,500
He won't listen.
He just says, "Make it work."

47
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,542
And what if it works?

Peg, please, I'm so bored.

65
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,500
No. No phones.

66
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,167
Why can't she have her phone?

67
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,458
'Cause she's mean.

68
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:29,542
No. Because she's afraid that I will tweet

69
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,958
an ethnic slur.

70
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,667
Again.

71
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,042
Yes. And you agreed no phone
for the rest of the media cycle.

72
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,875
I didn't even know that
that word referred to Jewish people.

73
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,250
I thought it was a generic term for cheap.

74
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,333
"Jewy"?

75
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,875
Everything is so woke these days,
it's out of control.

76
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:51,917
Yes.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,458
Love you. Yes.

78
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:56,500
And I say it like I see it, no filter.

79
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,250
If people can't handle it,
that's their problem. What's this?

80
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,958
Don't know. Some guy just dropped it off.

81
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,750
All right, genius, what is this thing?

82
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,667
- Well<i><font color="white">…</i>
- It's a Miles invitation.

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,542
Well, duh! But I mean, what is it?

84
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,000
- It's just like a block of wood.
- There's gotta be a way to open it.

85
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,542
It's solid.
<font color="white">There's no latches or even visible seams.

86
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,125
The wood-grain pattern's weird though.
It's like it's familiar.

87
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,625
Hmm. Oh, wait. Hold on. It's Birdie.

88
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,208
Okay, how do you open this thing?

89
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,833
- Hi, Birdie. Lionel's on two. Hi, Peg!
- Hi!</font>

90
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:32,125
Oh no. Peg's putting out a fire.
She'll be back.

91
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,417
Another fire? Bird.
What'd you say this time?

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,458
- No.
<font color="white">- You've got to stay off the Twitter.

93
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:41,167
It's nothing like that. It's fine.
Now, is this a Miles thing?

94
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,583
Have you figured out
how to open it, Lionel?

95
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,583
Lionel, use your science brain.

96
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,667
I'm working on it.
Bird, should you really be having a party?

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,167
No, they're all in my pod. It's fine.
Has anyone heard from Duke?

98
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,333
- No.
<font color="white">- No.

99
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,250
So this has gotten
some attention recently,

100
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,458
so obviously
I would like to speak to this,

101
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,792
and the answer is no, Jimmy Kimmel,

102
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,500
I do not hate boobs.

103
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:09,958
Boobs give us many useful things.
Boobs give us milk, cheese.

104
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:13,375
Breasts nourish our young until the age
where we can go out and hunt for them.

105
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,250
Let's be honest. Boobs are fun.

106
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,042
There's nothing wrong with that,
right, babe?

107
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,750
I love my boobs. They're so much fun.

108
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,167
- Oops! Sorry, feminists!
- Sorry, feminists.

109
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,167
So when we're talking
about the breast-ification of America…

110
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,208
I mean, what that means
is a breakdown in the natural order.

111
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,500
Evolutionary truths
that go back billions of years.

112
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,625
So when you're asking
a young man in America

113
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,792
to slow down so a woman can catch up…

114
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,708
Duke!

115
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:42,167
For centuries, the Western workplace
has been dominated by men 'cause…

116
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,417
- Dukey!
- …that's what nature made us to do.

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,542
Dukey! I've been calling you.
You gotta answer me when I call!

118
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,792
Mom! Will you shut it?
We've been over this a million times.

119
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,250
I told you. When me and Whiskey are live,
you gotta let us...

120
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,708
You tell your mother to shut up?

121
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,625
- Sorry. It's just when we're live...
- What?

122
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,250
- When we're...
- What?

123
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,750
Jeez, Mom. I'm sorry.

124
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,708
You got a delivery. It's in the kitchen.

125
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,583
Maybe it's sensitive to heat.

126
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,583
Wait. It's Duke. Hold on.

127
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,875
- Duke!
- <font color="white">- <i>Hey, what is this thing?</i>

128
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,625

129
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,708
<i><font color="white">She did something to it.
It opened up. I don't know. She broke it.</i>

130
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:23,917
A stereogram!

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,208
<i><font color="white">A what-a-gram?</i>

132
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,000
<i>Wait, a stereogram!
Were those the things...</i>

133
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
<i>Magic eye things?
I could never do those.</i>

134
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,500
<i><font color="white">Ma! What did I tell you
about touching my stuff?</i>

135
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,875
Do you group them by color maybe or…

136
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,833
Size? Weight? Should I weigh them?

137
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,208
Eight by eight. It's a chessboard.
This is a chess endgame.

138
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,708
So it's… It's set up
for a mate in one. Should I...

139
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,292
Do it, Kasparov.

140
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,542
That's tic-tac-toe! I know this!

141
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,500
- But it's solved already, so it can't be.
- It's tic-tac-toe.

142
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,375
But thank you
for contributing, Birdie. Yes.

It's a compass.

153
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,583
- Ma!
<font color="white">- It's a compass!

154
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,167
Okay, north, south…

155
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,917
Okay, N is for north,
so turn it due north.

156
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,708
- It's music. Guys, it's music!
- Shh!</font>

157
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,958
- Are you mocking me?
- Yes.</font>

158
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,542
Okay, ha-ha, I'm gonna Shazam it.

159
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,750
What is that?

160
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:02,208
Alexa, Shazam this song please.
Alexa, Shazam this song please.

161
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,792
Hey, this is Bach's <i>Little Fugue</i>
in G Minor.

162
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,417
- You sure?
<font color="white">- Yeah.

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,542
Uh, I'm Shazam-ing it.
Alexa, Shazam this song please.

164
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:14,750
So a fugue is a beautiful musical puzzle
based on just one tune.

165
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,250
<i>And when you layer this tune
on top of itself,</i>

166
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,417
it starts to change
and turns into a beautiful new structure.

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,583
This can't Shazam. It's a lamp.

168
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,208
- I love you, Birdie.
- I love you too, Claire.

169
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,708
Wait. "La-la-layered back over itself."
Hold on.

170
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,167
See this center wheel? Lift it up.

171
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,208
A whole new tune.

172
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,125
Freaking Miles, man. Genius.

173
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,667
That first one's
a Fibonacci sequence.

174
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,625
Ma!

175
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,667
No, get your hand off of that.

176
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,833
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

177
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,125
Forty-seven for sure?

178
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,292
That's the atomic number for silver.

179
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,875
- Are you... Are you sure that's silver?
- That's silver.

180
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,500
So this is it.

181
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,250
All together now. One, two, three.

182
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,625
Look at that.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,167
"My dear friends, my beautiful disruptors,
my closest inner circle…"

184
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,833
"…we could use a moment of normalcy.
And so you are cordially invited…"

185
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,250
"…for a long weekend
on my private island…"

186
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,917
"…where we will celebrate the bonds
that connect us,

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
and I hope
<font color="white">your puzzle-solving skills are whetted."

188
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,958
"Because you will also be competing
to solve the mystery…"

189
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,042
Whoo!

190
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,750
"…of my murder."

191
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,292
"Travel details to come.
Please forward any dietary restrictions."

192
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,083
"Love and all my kisses, Miles."

193
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,750
Ma! Where's my speargun?
I gotta pack. Babe, get packing!

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,708
What's that?

195
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,708
I don't know.

196
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,083
Whoo!

197
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,500
Wait… Hold on.

198
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,958
What just happened?

199
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:43,375
<i>Blanc. I saw you go in the engine room.</i>

200
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,458
<i>You're the Imposter. We all know it.</i>

201
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,542
<i>Case closed. We're done.</i>

202
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,917
I don't understand this at all.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,375
So Angie caught me,
and now the game's just over?

204
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,667
<i>Sorry, Blanc,
you're thrown out of the airlock.</i>

205
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,792
<i>It's a no-brainer.</i>

206
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,708
<i>I've got to say,</i>

207
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,125
<i>the world's greatest detective…
I thought you'd be better at this.</i>

208
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,250
I think maybe
this game's just not my thing.

209
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,583
<i>Maybe we should try</i> Quiplash.

210
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,375
<i>Uh, or</i><font color="white"> Codenames.

211
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,125
No. No, I…

212
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,250
Look, I appreciate
what y'all are trying to do for me here.

213
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>We're worried about you, buddy.
Lockdown hasn't been easy for any of us.</i>

214
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,542
<i>But Phillip told me
you haven't left the bath for a week.</i>

215
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,708
Oh, that's hyperbole.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,292
Get that, would ya?

217
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,083
You're not in the bath again,
are you?

218
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,958
No!

219
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,750
I'm just…

220
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,875
I lose it between cases anyway.

221
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,833
I think I might be going insane.

222
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:44,542
My mind is a fueled-up racing car,
and I got nowhere to drive it.

223
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,083
<i>Hey, can I ask… Have you tried crosswords?</i>

224
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,583
No, no, Natasha.

225
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:53,083
I… I don't need puzzles or games.
The last thing I need is a vacation.

226
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,792
I need danger, a hunt, a challenge.

227
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:02,167
I need… a great case.

228
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,125
Blanc?
There's someone here for you!

229
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,042
With a box!

230
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,417
Whoo.

231
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,917
<font color="white">Claire, my dear!

232
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,458
Hi, you genius!

233
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,625
Whoo-hoo!

234
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:09,875
Hello! Oh my God!

235
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
- We can't hug, right?
- No!

236
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,083
- I mean, can we?
- Hi, Peg!

237
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,750
- I wanna hug everybody.
- Elbows!

238
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,500
- You need help?
- Yes, please!

239
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,083
Did you two stay at the hotel last night?
I didn't see you.

240
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,375
No, Birdie,
we clearly just arrived.

241
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,375
But you… Hello, stranger danger.

242
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,542
Mr. Blanc! You are stranger danger?

243
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,333
No, that's fine, Nikos.
I don't even know what that means.

244
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,250
Wait a second. Benoit Blanc?

245
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,500
Oh my God.
Are you Benoit Blanc, the detective?

246
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,917
Did you solve the murder of…
Ah, what's her name?

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,333
That… The ballet dancer
with the thing and the thing. That's you?

248
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,458
It is, in the flesh.

249
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,833
I'm obviously familiar
with you all as well.

250
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:56,125
Governor. Dr. Toussaint. Miss Birdie Jay.

251
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,042
What an extraordinary gathering.

252
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,333
Whoo-hoo!

253
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,500
Crew! We've arrived.

254
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,708
Disruptors have assembled!

255
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,000
- No, no, absolutely not.
- Duke!

256
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,792
- The Duke.
- Duke, hello.

257
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,833
Hey, guys.

258
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,750
- Remember my girl, Whiskey?
- Hi.</font>

259
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,458
Of course, Whiskey. Hello.

260
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,333
Who's that?

261
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,333
Why are you in Greece, Mr. Blanc?

262
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,208
I was invited by Miles Bron.

263
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:39,750
Tight with Miles?

264
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,167
No, never met.

265
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,917
Oh, I get it.
The, uh… The murder mystery thing.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,667
Benoit Blanc is going to help solve
the mystery of Miles' murder.

267
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,417
- This should be fun.
- Cute.

268
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, we'll see.

269
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,833
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Greece.

270
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,167
This fine craft will take you
to Mr. Bron's island.

271
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,583
It is a two-hour journey.

272
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,917
Your captain, Mr. Andino,
will assist you with your luggage.

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,958
But first, I'm gonna need you
to remove your masks

274
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,208
and extend your tongue.

275
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:22,250
This will only be
momentarily uncomfortable.

276
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,458
Mr. Cody.

277
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,875
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

278
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,167
There's no pineapple.

279
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,958
Well, it seems
I'm the odd man out, Governor.

280
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,417
You're all friends.

281
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,917
Miles does one
of these weekend reunions every year.

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Some… nutso invitation.
Some extravagant trip.

283
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,250
Just a little… …menagerie.

284
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,125
Excuse me,
<font color="white">I love your accent. I had to try it. Oh.

285
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,833
Oh!

286
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,333
Eight years of doing these trips,

287
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,917
you're the first new person
he's ever invited.

288
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
- You must be very special.
- Oh! Oh, well…

289
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,958
What is this material? I love it.

290
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,792
- Cotton, I think.
- Sir.</font>

291
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
Uh…

292
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,167
What is that?

293
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,333
Open, please.

294
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,917
You won't be needing that anymore.

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,458
- I won't?
- You're good.

296
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,750
What is that?
Is that some kind of disinfectant or<i>…</font></i>

297
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,500
You're good. Have a great trip, everyone.

298
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,667
Andi! Hi!

299
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,875
Holy shit.

300
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,125
I could not help but notice
the stir at her arrival.

301
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,167
Yeah. That was a stir.

302
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,083
She's not in your little gang?

303
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,875
She was... She is.

304
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,292
Andi started Alpha with Miles
ten years ago, just the two of them.

305
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,958
That's Cassandra Brand?

306
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,250
Andi, yeah.

307
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,708
And they're no longer partners?

308
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,000
In one legal move,
he cut her out completely.

309
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,125
Booted her without a dime,
<i>Social Network'd</i> her.

310
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,375
Lord. But he still invited her
to this weekend?

311
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,208
The question isn't,
"Why did he invite her?"

312
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,792
It's, "Why did she show up?"

313
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,667
Is that dock a Banksy?

314
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,833
Pisceshite.

315
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,708
Oh, is that the name of the island
in Greek?

316
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,708
Pisceshite.

317
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,417
Pisceshite. Pisceshite.

318
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,833
Miles!

319
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,208
Oh, my baby, Birdie!

320
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,417
Oh, with your island!

321
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,000
- Serenading me with my song!
- On the guitar Paul wrote it on.

322
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,417
I know, legit, right?

323
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,625
But look at your face.
It was worth it. Oh!

324
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,625
My friends, my friends,
oh, my old friends.

325
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,083
Are we allowed to hug
after the whole Men in Black thing?

326
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:16,333
- We can hug. Okay.
- Oh, God, bring it in.

327
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,750
- Oh! We're allowed to hug.
- Ah. Aw.

328
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,708
Duke!

329
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,958
Hey, buddy. This is a dream.

330
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,583
Not a dream, wide awake.
And it feels so good.

331
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,542
Whiskey.

332
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,083
Wow. I just… I love that necklace.

333
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,917
- Great. Come on, bring it in.
- This old thing?

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,042
- How you doing?
- I'm so good.

335
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,167
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm. Great island.

336
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,917
Greek island, huh? Sexy, right?

337
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
So, uh, Benoit Blanc, huh?

338
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,583
Hmm?

339
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,375
Man, when you throw
a murder mystery party,

340
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,542
you do it right, buddy.

341
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,458
Dukey.

342
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:50,708
- My man.
- Hey, pal.

343
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,167
- Good to see you.
- You too, buddy.

344
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,167
Hello.

345
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,958
Mr. Bron, I cannot overstate
my gratitude for this, I...

346
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,000
So happy to meet...

347
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:09,958
Andi.

348
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,542
You're here.

349
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,417
I am.

350
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,292
All right,
<font color="white">when's the murder mystery start?

351
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,292
My man, patience. Patience.

352
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,125
Okay, look,
<font color="white">I know you guys think I'm a hippie,

353
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,167
but can we just take a second

354
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,167
and fully inbreathiate
this moment together?

355
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,458
Mmm.

356
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,125
We're old friends. We're still friends.

357
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,958
And I love you all.

358
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,042
I just wanted to say that.

359
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:43,625
But we got a great weekend,
just our gang, just us.

360
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,750
Hey, hey!

361
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,917
Hey, bro.

362
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,542
I'm not here.

363
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,500
Who's that?

364
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,542
That's Derol. He's just staying here.
He's going through things,

365
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,875
but he's not part of
the experience at all, okay?

366
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:01,625
So first,
<font color="white">a proper tour of the Glass Onion.

367
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,625
- Here we go.
- Oh my God.

368
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,625
The Glass Onion, like our bar!
Oh, I loved that baby so much.

369
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,458
Should we, um, get our bags, um…

370
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,000
Sun is blinding.

371
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,833
…or someone will get them for us. Okay.

372
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,042
I could use a second
in the shade.

373
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,958
- This rich-people shit is weird.
- Thank you.

374
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:23,208
I… I have occasionally
put on the dog in my life, but this…

375
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,917
This is stretching
my stride-taking abilities.

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,042
You're doing great. I'm Andi.

377
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,750
That is very genial of you. I'm Benoit.

378
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,750
- You got a flat tire there.
- Thank you.

379
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,667
Oh, wow. Okay.

380
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,042
Wow!

381
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,833
It's like an actual huge glass onion.

382
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:47,292
- Yep.
- It's past, present and future.

383
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,708
It's what came before, where I am now,
what I'll leave to the world.

384
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:52,708
Ignore me.

385
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,958
This is the full reclamation of everything
I've achieved up to now...

386
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,042
So, what kind of staff does it take
to run a place like this?

387
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,875
Normally like 50, but, you know…
Look, I sent everyone home.

388
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,125
I just wanna have a normal weekend
with my old friends like the old days.

389
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,542
Right? See, look, that's the thing.

390
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,792
This isn't just
a rich-asshole house. It's…

391
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,833
I mean, it's not even a house.

392
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,042
It's a… It's a commune. For creativity.

393
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,583
Oh, amazing.

394
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:22,625
<i>Dong!</i>

395
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,833
What is that?

396
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:27,917
That's the hourly dong.
You know I got Phil Glass to compose that?

397
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,292
- What?
<font color="white">- Who's Phil Gas?

398
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,583
Okay, let's stop talking and actually
start hanging out and having fun.

399
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,792
Your rooms are assigned by the chakra

400
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,083
that I most closely associate
with each of you.

401
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,083
I know. Go with it, okay?

402
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,583
Your biorhythm monitor
is the key to your room.

403
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,292
- It'll lead you to the room using haptics.
- Oh my God.

404
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,292
Get settled in, change.
Let's meet up at the pool.

405
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,958
We'll have a chill afternoon.
And then the game begins.

406
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,375
Ooh.

407
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,208
Sacral! You know me, Miles.

408
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,083
Oh, Miles.

409
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,750
- Ooh.
<font color="white">- Hey, Andi…

410
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,792
Sacral!

411
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,333
I really am glad you're here.

412
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:16,125
Wow. I… I'm sorry, but that is just crazy.

413
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,000
- I know. Hey, Mr. Blanc.
- Hmm?

414
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,500
- Could we have a quick word?
- Mmm, of course.

415
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh my word. This…

416
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,625
Oh my goodness, me. This is…

417
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,958
That is<i><font color="white">… </i>Wait, what is that?

418
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:45,375
Oh my God, it's full of stars!

419
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,250
2010, the year we made contact, that's…

420
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,542
Um, this is amazing, just amazing.

421
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,875
I… I'm so happy to be here under…

422
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:57,500
If there's any role you'd like me to play
in this murder mystery game

423
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:02,250
as the… I don't know, detective,
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

424
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,125
Just to be included and to… To meet you…

425
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,167
Is that a motorcar?

426
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,458
Oh, yeah. That's my Baby Blue.

427
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:16,000
It's one-of-a-kind. Goes anywhere I go.
All around the world.

428
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,542
Why is it on the roof?

429
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,083
'Cause there's nowhere to drive it
on the island.

430
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,208
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

431
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,792
Mr. Blanc, uh…

432
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,375
I wanted to ask,

433
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,125
what are you doing here?

434
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,167
I'm sorry?

435
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,542
What are you doing here?

436
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,000
Uh, you invited me.

437
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,750
No, I didn't.

438
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,458
What…

439
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,500
You sent me a box.

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,083
- Wait, you received a box?
- Yes.

441
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:55,542
The wooden box was delivered to my home
with some simple children's puzzles

442
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:59,083
which, once I completed them,
there was an invitation inside.

443
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,542
Do you have that invitation?

444
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,167
Well, yes, I do.

445
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,667
I'm sorry. I'm… I'm very confused.

446
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,708
Is this part of the game?

447
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:09,792
No.

448
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,833
This is just like the other ones,
but I didn't send it to you.

449
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,625
How many of these boxes did you create?

450
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,292
- Five. One for each of my friends.
- No test boxes? No prototypes?

451
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,750
No, my puzzle guy barely got the five done
in time,

452
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,250
and he apprenticed with Ricky Jay.

453
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:32,125
And once the boxes are open
and the puzzles completed,

454
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,083
is there any way to close them again?
To… To reset 'em?

455
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,875
Hang on. Hang on.

456
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,875
Someone reset the box.

457
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:46,833
Someone reset the box.
They sent it to you as a gag.

458
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:51,417
"Miles is doing a murder mystery.
Let's invite Benoit freaking Blanc."

459
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,792
It's so good.

460
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:57,208
I am mortified. I don't...

461
00:26:57,292 --> 00:27:01,500
Why? I've got the predefinite detective
in the world at my murder mystery party.

462
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,250
That is so legit.

463
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,167
Mr. Bron, I've learned
through bitter experience

464
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,667
that an anonymous invitation
is not to be trifled with.

465
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,125
Okay, look, come on.
I'd love to have you visit me in my home.

466
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,375
There, you've been invited.
You're an official guest now.

467
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,083
Thrilled to have you.
I mean, relax. Enjoy yourself.

468
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:25,958
Hey, try to solve
the murder mystery if you can.

469
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:29,333
I don't want to toot my own horn,
but it's pretty next level.

470
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:30,833
I'm gonna foil. See you at the pool.

471
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,375
Lionel, you are too sexy
to be a scientist.

472
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:59,083
And, Claire… you look so cute.

473
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,458
Aw, thanks, Bird.

474
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,333
You really try. I like that.
You really make an effort.

475
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,417
Well, I figured, Greece.

476
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,333
And no masks, I can breathe again.

477
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,500
Look at this pool.
I think I'll go for a swim.

478
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,458
Maybe I'll lay out for a bit.

479
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,792
AK and Flea get all the credit,

480
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,667
but Frusciante really
is the heart of the Chili Peppers.

481
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,000
- Hey, Blanc! Have a dip.
- Hey.

482
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,167
Grab a hard kombucha.
They're actually pretty good.

483
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,667
Jared Leto sent 'em over.
I think he wants me to invest.

484
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,917
- Well, I am on vacation, so…
- Hey, booch me!

485
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,083
There you go.

486
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,083
Yeah.

487
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,542
Oh! The Baby Blue!

488
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,542
Iconic.

489
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,417
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside...

490
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,042
Anderson Cooper's birthday.

491
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,917
Coop's parties are memorable.

492
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,000
- <i>Dong!</i>
- <font color="white">- Yep!

493
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,375
Oh, God.

494
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,583
Really, Duke?

495
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,333
<font color="white">Oh my God!

496
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:05,292
Really.

497
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,208
Asshole.

498
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,083
Now it's a party.

499
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,292
That is quite a piece.

500
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,875
- Never without it.
- Mmm.</font>

501
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,292
- So I see.
- You never know when shit's gonna go down.

502
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,333
Ah…

503
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,375
Birdie. You have to tell him.

504
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,083
- You gotta tell him.
- I will.

505
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,708
- I'm serious. You gotta...
- I will.

506
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,167
- I will.
<font color="white">- You just gotta go beg.

507
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,250
- Okay?
<font color="white">- Oh, God.

508
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,000
When he goes to his room,
just follow him and then do it.

509
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,417
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

510
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,958
Cool me off. Gimme a sip of that.

511
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,750
- I'm hot for both...
- That's so hot.

512
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,625
There was a time, you know, back when…

513
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,250
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

514
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,458
He couldn't believe
he was even talking to me.

515
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He said that to me.

516
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,333
"You're Birdie Jay, on billboards.
I can't believe I'm talking to you."

517
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,625
He was this little thing in my hand.

518
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:18,917
I preferred that.

519
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:33,458
Andi! Hi! Wow.

520
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,333
How long has it been?

521
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,583
Since the trial. So a few months.

522
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,583
Mmm, the trial, ugh. That was not fun.

523
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,792
I mean, for all of us.
For anybody. Right, Peg?

524
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,000
Right? I'm uncomfortable.
I'm gonna go for a swim.

525
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,542
Now, I can handle
the Matisse in the bathroom,

526
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,833
but is, uh… Is that a fax machine?

527
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:03,542
Miles doesn't even have a phone.

528
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,875
It's really convenient. I have one number,

529
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,292
goes to all my fax machines
all over the world.

530
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,625
There's something about analog that's...

531
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,792
Oh! Look at this blast from my past.

532
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,750
{\an8}<font color="white">Look, everybody. Look.

533
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,167
Miles, you're so funny,
having this around.

534
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,583
May I ask,
if it isn't too presumptuous of me,

535
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,542
what first drew you all together?

536
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,583
You're such an eclectic bunch.

537
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:29,375
I think disruptors recognize each other.

538
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,292
Yes.

539
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,250
Now you've used
that word before, "disruptors."

540
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,583
What does that mean?

541
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,542
Some people think
Birdie's disruptive

542
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,125
every time she opens her mouth.

543
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,958
I mean, just because she says
what everyone's thinking,

544
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,000
but no one's got the nerve to say.

545
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,917
It's true. I say it like I see it.

546
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,167
No. But seriously, you know about
Sweetie Pants, right?

547
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,542
I'm going to embarrass myself here.

548
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,792
I adore Sweetie Pants. I live in mine...

549
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:58,333
You're sitting next to Birdie Jay.
She was a fashion icon.

550
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,500
And then the youngest editor ever
of </font><i><font color="white">She She Magazine.</i> Right?

551
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:05,542
Establishment BS,
on top of the world, but then…

552
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,792
Well…

553
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,292
Then there was the whole thing
with the Halloween costume.

554
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,208
Oh.

555
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:16,125
It was a tribute to Beyoncé,
but people did not take it that way.

556
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,875
- Anyway, I had a lot of time at home.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,625
- I just spent all my time in my...
- Oh, in sweatpants.

558
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,708
She comes out with designer,
high quality, comfortable sweatpants

559
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:27,375
just as a pandemic hits.

560
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,583
She disrupted her own disruption.
She made a killing.

561
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,833
And look at Duke.
You think people looked at him

562
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,375
and saw anything other than the beef?

563
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:39,792
You think they saw the first influencer
to have a million followers on Twitch?

564
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,583
Yes, I did. Here it is.
Deal with it.

565
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,125
- Hello.
- <font color="white">- What about Claire?

566
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:48,458
You know, soccer mom in beige
throwing grenades into machine politics.

567
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:52,583
Lionel, he didn't wait ten years
licking on the taint of academia

568
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,292
to get permission to start pushing
the boundaries of science.

569
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,833
He just did it.
That's what I did with Al...

570
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,542
That's what <i>we</font></i><font color="white"> did with Alpha.
Disrupt. See…

571
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,542
Tell you a little secret.
Your worldview's gonna change.

572
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:14,083
Once you hear it, you can't unhear it.
Is your phone turned off?

573
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,583
- Oh, I left it in my room.
- Okay.

574
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:22,208
If you want to shake things up,
you start with something small.

575
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,792
You break a norm,
or an idea, or a convention,

576
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,958
some little business model.

577
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:29,458
But you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway.

578
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:32,667
Everybody gets excited
because you're busting up something

579
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,833
that everyone wanted broken
in the first place.

580
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,000
That's the infraction point.

581
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,625
That's the place
where you have to look within yourself

582
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,667
and ask, "Am I the kind of person
who will keep going?"

583
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,333
Will you break more things?

584
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:51,958
Break bigger things?

585
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:56,917
Are you willing to break <i>the</font></i><font color="white"> thing
that nobody wants you to break?

586
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:01,750
Because at that point,
people are not gonna be on your side.

587
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,833
They're gonna call you crazy.

588
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,125
They're gonna say you're a bully.
They're gonna tell you to stop.

589
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,417
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

590
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,917
Because as it turns out,

591
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,958
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

592
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,375
But that is what true disruption is.

593
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,042
And that is what unites all of us.

594
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:32,750
We all got to that line and crossed it.

595
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,417
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

596
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,042
- See?
- Yeah, yeah.

597
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,542
So, disruptors.

598
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:40,708
All of us.

599
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,375
Wow.

600
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,292
Mmm!

601
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:51,292
That was some real red-pill stuff, Miles.

602
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:55,333
The Andi I built Alpha with?
She believed it.

603
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:56,750
Oh, I believed it.

604
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,250
I believed it.

605
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:02,417
Mr. Blanc, you're a detective, right?

606
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,750
Yes, I'm…

607
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,542
Can you spot the other thing?

608
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,417
The real thing this group has in common?

609
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,833
Andi, come on.

610
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:14,625
Oh, Lionel.
<font color="white">Everybody knows who Lionel works for.

611
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:15,958
That's no secret.

612
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,708
And we know
<font color="white">who bankrolled Claire's campaign.

613
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,083
But when nobody…

614
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,792
Nobody would touch Birdie
with a ten-foot pole

615
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:31,292
because she went on <i>Oprah</i>
<font color="white">and compared herself to Harriet Tubman…

616
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,458
In spirit! Oh, God.

617
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,625
…who do you think showed up

618
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,208
as an angel investor
in Sweetie Pants? Huh?

619
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:39,417
And Duke.

620
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,167
When Duke got banned from Twitch

621
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,583
for hawking rhino-horn boner pills
to teenage boys…

622
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,250
There was zero rhino in those pills.

623
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,125
…who set him up at YouTube

624
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,875
and used their media empire
to promote the stream?

625
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,583
That is the common thread here.

626
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:56,083
Every single one of you
is holding on for dear life

627
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,083
to Miles Bron's golden titties.

628
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,417
And each of you,

629
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,208
you'll stab a friend in the back
to hold on.

630
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,958
That is what I believe.

631
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,000
Andi, wait.

632
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,542
Wow.

633
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,125
That was so real.

634
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,542
Anyway, dinner's at 8:00.

635
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,000
See you all there? Yeah.

636
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,625
Like Miles said,

637
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:48,542
I'm a truth-teller.
Some people can't handle it.

638
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,625
It's a dangerous thing
to mistake speaking without thought

639
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,000
for speaking the truth.

640
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,375
Don't you think?

641
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Are you calling me dangerous?

642
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,875
Well, we'll see.

643
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,250
If you'll excuse me.

644
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,250
Something's off.

645
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,042
What do you mean?

646
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,208
She's changed.

647
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,750
What's she playing at?

648
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,042
Mr. Bron! Wait!

649
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,750
Hey, hi.

650
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,583
- Hello.
- <font color="white">- Uh…

651
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,042
- Please don't do this.
- Sorry?

652
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,167
Bird showed me the statement you want her
to make to the press about Bangladesh,

653
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,833
and if you make her go through with it,
her name is…

654
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,542
destroyed.

655
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:53,875
But you see, my resume
is just Birdie Jay, Birdie Jay,

656
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,125
a short stint in retail,
and then Birdie Jay.

657
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,333
So if her name is destroyed,
then my name is…

658
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,625
I… I'm sorry…

659
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,708
It's Peg.

660
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:12,292
I'm begging you.
You gotta get her to make that statement.

661
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,375
It is her only way out.

662
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,333
- What...
<font color="white">- Okay, good.

663
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,292
But, uh…

664
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:32,625
<i>Dong!</i>

665
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,625
<i>This is a smokeless garden.</i>

666
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:04,208
<i>This is a smokeless garden.
This is a smokeless garden.</i>

667
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,417
<i>Please, keep our water clean.</i>

668
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,125
<i>Please, keep our water clean.
Please, keep our water clean.</i>

669
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,917
Are you gonna do it for me?

670
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,750
Mm-hmm.

671
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,917
<i>♪ There's a light ♪</i>

672
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,125
<i>♪ A certain kind of light ♪</i>

673
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,708
Wow!

674
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:10,333
<i>♪ That never shone on me ♪</i>

675
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,500

676
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,500

00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,375

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,625
<i>♪ There's a way… ♪</i>

679
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:27,417
Welcome, gang.
A few cocktails before I'm murdered.

680
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,667
I think I remember everyone's favorite.

681
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,333
And we got tamales.

682
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,542
My chemist.

683
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,167
- Mmm, Lagavulin 16.
- He likes it heavy on the peat.

684
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,375
Serve it up neat.

685
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,500
Is this my Cuban Breeze?

686
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:44,667
The drink that got us on the no-fly list
at St. Barts. What else?

687
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,167
Well, #Worthlt.

688
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,042
- Claire-bear.
- Hmm?

689
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,958
- Room temp white.
- Pinot Gris.

690
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,458
Halle Berry! That has a kick.

691
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,708
Oh, that's Jeremy Renner's
small-batch hot sauce.

692
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,042
I let him invest. He sends me
a pallet every year. Take a few bottles.

693
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,625
Well… …thank you.

694
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:06,458
I apologize. I don't know your drink,
but, you know, pick your poison.

695
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,583
Hey, Andi.

696
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,667
I'm hoping it's still whiskey soda.

697
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:19,417
- You know I...
- Okay. Miles.

698
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,750
I mean,
I know you have a thing for it, but…

699
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,875
I mean, this place is the Tate Modern!

700
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:30,583
Why would you hang a framed print
of the <i><font color="white">Mona Lisa</i> front and center?

701
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:33,042
It's like having a Che poster
in your dorm room.

702
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,875
Mm-hmm.

703
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:35,792
Or…

704
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,458
Come on.

705
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:41,750
Wait.

706
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,833
- That's impossible, Miles.
- Mm-hmm.

707
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:47,667
Forgive my incredulity, but surely…
No, the <i>Mona Lisa,</i>

708
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,292
that's property of the state.
There's no way...

709
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,750
Blame it on the pando, Blanc.

710
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,292
The Louvre was closed,
France needed money,

711
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,000
and so I bought myself
a little short-term loan.

712
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:01,417
It turns out the transport
and the security was most of the cost.

713
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,375
Check this out.

714
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,917
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

715
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,833
Don't tell the insurance guys,

716
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,500
but I had
<font color="white">a little override button installed.

717
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,542
- Oh, you did.
- Where do you think it is?

718
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,125
Oh, my gosh! It's easy.

719
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,583
It's so freaking sensitive.

720
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,500
A phone dings, it closes up.
It's ridiculous,

721
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:25,792
but I needed to be able to look her
in the eyes without glass in between us.

722
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,208
My mom took me to Paris
when I was six years old.

723
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,500
First time I looked at this lady,
it changed my life.

724
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,333
You know da Vinci invented a technique
for brushstrokes that leave no lines?

725
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:44,250
That's how you can look straight at her,
and her expression changes every time.

726
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:48,500
Her smile's there, then it disappears.
Is she happy? Is she sad?

727
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,667
Is it something else?

728
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,042
This simple thing
that you thought you were looking at,

729
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:59,000
it suddenly takes on layers
and depth so complex,

730
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:00,958
it gives you vertigo.

731
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,250
It really is something.

732
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,917
It's a classic.

733
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,625
Hey. Not here.

734
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:13,083
Every time we've gotten to the point
where I'm going to strangle you,

735
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:15,333
you pull something like this,
and it's magic.

736
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:17,792
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Look, it all started with her.

737
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,708
What did I say to you guys?

738
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,417
The first night we hung out
at the Glass Onion, what did I say?

739
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,708
I wanna be responsible
for something that gets mentioned

740
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:26,958
in the same breath as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

741
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,000
Forever.

742
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,625
A-and what does that mean?

743
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,250
Oh, it means immortality.

744
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,417
He wants to do something
that's gonna change...

745
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,875
Wait a minute, Miles.

746
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:39,500
Why do you have the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
in your living room?

747
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,167
In one week,

748
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,833
I've invited world leaders
and members of the press from all over

749
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,167
to come to this island.

750
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,208
And right here,
I'm going to unveil the future.

751
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,000
<font color="white">You know what this is?

752
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,875
You know damn well we do.

753
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:00,208
What's going on, Miles?

754
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,125
Uh… I don't.

755
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,042
- Don't drop it.
- Oh my God.

756
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,125
That's a new solid hydrogen fuel.
It's incredibly powerful.

757
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,458
It's radically efficient.

758
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:13,542
Zero carbon emissions,
and it's derived from abundant seawater.

759
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,458
I call it Klear, with a K.

760
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:20,500
And at this event,
we are going to announce "Klear America."

761
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,583
Our affordable home power solution.

762
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:25,333
Klear is going to be powering
people's dreams,

763
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,917
all over this country,
by the end of this year.

764
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:31,417
No.

765
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,917
No. Because I was clear with you.

766
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,708
I told you I need two years minimum

767
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:40,917
to test this stuff
to see if it's safe or even viable.

768
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,542
Claire and I are not gonna be responsible
for putting something out in the world

769
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,292
before it's tested and...

770
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,208
Oh, no.

771
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,208
Oh, yeah.

772
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,708
No.

773
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,750
You're running this entire place off this?

774
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,208
All of it. All this awesome lighting,

775
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:07,000
the heating and cooling,
everything right down to my fax machine.

776
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,958
The whole Glass Onion is powered by Klear.

777
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,333
Oh my God, Miles.

778
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,750
Guys, we did it.

779
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:16,792
I'm out. I'm done.

780
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:22,375
This is reckless.
And you're gonna get somebody killed.

781
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,292
Bro, you're not getting out.

782
00:45:24,917 --> 00:45:26,292
It's already happening.

783
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,917
I love you. Come on, let's… Let's eat!

784
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:35,625
Okay, gang.

785
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:41,500
It's been a memorable weekend already,
to be sure, but now the real fun starts.

786
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:47,417
We got three days to bask in the sun,
swim in the Ionian Sea,

787
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,750
eat good food and wine,
and enjoy each other's company.

788
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:54,958
But alongside and underneath the partay,
you've been charged with a serious task.

789
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,750
Because tonight, in this very room,
a murder will be committed.

790
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,375
My murder.

791
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,708
You will have
to closely observe the crime.

792
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,000
Consider what you know about each other.

793
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:12,375
Know that across the island,
I've hidden clues.

794
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:16,625
Some may be helpful, some may misdirect.
That's for you to determine.

795
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:23,542
But if anyone can name the killer,
tell me how they achieved the murder,

796
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:26,875
and, most importantly,
what was the motive,

797
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,042
that person wins our game.

798
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,583
Any questions?

799
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,625
Uh, wait… What do we win?

800
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,250
I… What do you mean? What do you…

801
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,125
What do you want?

802
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,792
No. No, nothing, I just…

803
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,458
I just thought maybe
there was a prize or something.

804
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:51,042
I… An iPad or like…

805
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,125
Okay, fine.
<font color="white">Yeah, no, the winner gets an iPad.

806
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:01,875
And, uh, once you're dead,
will we still be able to talk to you?

807
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:05,542
Yeah, I'm not playing dead
the whole weekend, dude.

808
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:06,708
We hang, but I…

809
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,417
You just can't ask me questions.
I'm not gonna help.

810
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,000
I don't actually need an iPad.
I'm just saying. It's just…

811
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:16,583
When you said "win," it…
You know, it made me say it.

812
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,458
Can we, um, work together?

813
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:21,708
Um, only one person
can solve the crime,

814
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:25,583
so if you got a theory,
keep it close to your chest.

815
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,958
It's designed to be hard.
This will take the whole weekend.

816
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,792
Well, this is truly delightful.

817
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,292
Oh! Have we started already, is it...

818
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,792
- Well, the murder hasn't happened. But…
- Oh, yeah.

819
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:39,417
Yeah, why not? As Watson said to Holmes...

820
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,458
It was Birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow

821
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:47,542
in revenge for you stealing
her signature Ren Diamond.

822
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,458
Look at the seating arrangement.

823
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:58,375
It triangulates Birdie
just perfectly with that thing,

824
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,958
which is loaded with a dummy bolt.

825
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,667
Aimed directly…

826
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:07,542
at Mr. Bron.

827
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:13,333
Now I believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device,

828
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:19,500
but more damning,
that is a vintage Jayhawk brand crossbow.

829
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:22,167
Jayhawk, Birdie Jay.

830
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,875
Of course, there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues.

831
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,375
The hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter B.

832
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,833
Birdie's room is the sacral chakra,
which is the one blocked by guilt.

833
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:35,958
Blah, blah, blah. But the motive, yes,

834
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:40,000
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of </font><i><font color="white">The Face</i> magazine

835
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,750
with Birdie on the cover…

836
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:46,917
…she famously wore
what became known as the Ren Diamond.

837
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And that's a family heirloom, I believe.

838
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:53,958
Well, to be clear, I mean, I didn't know
what a "blood diamond" was so...

839
00:48:54,042 --> 00:49:00,083
Mr. Bron, the large pendulous locket
which is… Has not left your neck.

840
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:04,042
Bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style.

841
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,667
Would you kindly open it for us?

842
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:15,875
My Ren Diamond!

843
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:20,500
A dramatic, passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista.

844
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,917
Miss Birdie Jay.

845
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:28,208
Unfortunately, this crime clashed
with the presence of Benoit Blanc.

846
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:34,792
Oh!

847
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:39,500
That… See that? That just went up…
Very good. Very good.

848
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:48,167
My God, that just felt so good.
So solid, so satisfying!

849
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,625
You know, like one of those
mini-crosswords <i>The Times</i><font color="white"> has

850
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:56,083
or, you know, I have a chef friend,
and she speaks of trying to create

851
00:49:56,167 --> 00:50:01,833
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bite-sized...

852
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,167
You're angry.

853
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,000
No, Blanc, I'm, uh, just, you know…

854
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:16,708
What the hell?

855
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:21,458
That was not
the simplest thing to set up, so…

856
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:24,208
It's fine. It doesn't matter. It's just…

857
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,667
I hired Gillian Flynn
to write the whole thing...

858
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,583
- Oh, she's quite good.
- She's goddamn expensive, is what she is.

859
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:35,333
What am I supposed to do now?
Play Yahtzee all weekend? Just…

860
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,333
Mr. Bron, truth is,
I… I ruined your game on purpose

861
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,458
and for a very good reason.

862
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,875
I'm sorry, what?

863
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,708
I like the Glass Onion as a metaphor.

864
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:54,667
An object that seems densely layered,

865
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,583
but in reality
the center is in plain sight.

866
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:01,708
Your relationship with these people
may seem complex,

867
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,833
but look, what you've done
this weekend is crystal clear.

868
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,417
You've taken seven people,

869
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,792
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

870
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,792
gathered them together on a remote island

871
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:17,250
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

872
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:22,375
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

873
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,167
Oh, whoa.

874
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,375
Come on.

875
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,750
So you play hardball with Lionel,
threaten to destroy his reputation

876
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,500
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with Klear.

877
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,250
But now with Claire too…

878
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:39,083
Now perhaps,
you threaten to support her opponent

879
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:43,958
in the up-and-coming election
if she does not approve your power plant.

880
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,208
You have done some homework.

881
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:49,000
And Birdie. Bangladesh.

882
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,958
Sweetie Pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop.

883
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,458
You're making Birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor.

884
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:02,375
And Duke? Well…
…we all know why Duke wants to kill you.

885
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,208
He doesn't know about that.

886
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,208
Yes, he does.

887
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,667
Take my presence as a sign.

888
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:16,500
For at least one person on this island,
this is not a game.

889
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,833
Oh, this is the famous napkin!

890
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,792
I know this story.

891
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,125
- Right…
<font color="white">- Will you look at that?

892
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:29,708
I sketched out the original idea
for Alpha on a cocktail napkin

893
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,583
and I showed it to Andi one night
at the Glass Onion.

894
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,792
That was our local bar.

895
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:40,792
That's where it all began.
But they tore it down the year after that.

896
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:41,750
Mm-hmm.

897
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,500
Andi.

898
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,792
Yes, Andi.

899
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,875
Andi used to tell me the truth.

900
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,458
Nobody does that now.

901
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,167
It's all just fake smiles and agendas

902
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,250
and people wanting
what they think they're owed.

903
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:06,000
Hating you when you don't give it to them
because that's what you're there for.

904
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:15,333
I know it's probably hard to have sympathy
for the poor, tortured billionaire. But…

905
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,417
God damn, I miss that bar.

906
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,083
<i>♪ Yeah, listen… ♪</i>

907
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,292
You know, you could just power it down.

908
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,792
Ah, it's my Google Alerts.
Got them for all you guys.

909
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,000
Whiskey, sports I like, general interests.

910
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,708
You have a Google Alert
for the word "movie"?

911
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:52,208
I like movies. Don't hate. Nerd.

912
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:54,250
Oh, thank God for Benoit Blanc.

913
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,958
We don't have to
spend the weekend spelling hedges.

914
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,875
Well, I'm out of here.
Tomorrow morning. Gone.

915
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,708
We just got here.

916
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:05,542
You can stay, have fun.

917
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,292
Fine. You're murdering my vibe.

918
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,792
Well, I hate saying this
in any context,

919
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:12,792
but I'm with Duke.

920
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,583
Or we can get drunk
and enjoy paradise for the weekend.

921
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,750
We should probably go too.

922
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:22,792
No. Miserable in paradise.
We've all earned this.

923
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,042
Yes, you have.

924
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:32,083
Are we even gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

925
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,625
Or just gonna throw a blanket over it
and push through the weekend?

926
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,667
Am I the elephant?

927
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,250
Yeah. You're the elephant!

928
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,333
You're not that bad.

929
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,125
What'd you come for, Andi?

930
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,333
Given the circumstances,
I think it's a fair question.

931
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:46,792
Fair?

932
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:51,875
Oh my God. Yes, no, fine.
Nothing about any of this is fair.

933
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,583
Congratulations. Now, you know.

934
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,958
And we all stuck with Miles.
What do you want?

935
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:04,708
Do you wanna know why we did it? Hmm?
Really? Why? Do the math. It's easy math.

936
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:09,667
So you come here,
in your Gucci flats, telling us…

937
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,583
Valentino.

938
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:11,792
…that we owe you?

939
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,833
You made money off of Alpha
all those years.

940
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:16,583
You did fine. You got yours.

941
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:17,500
I got?

942
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:23,000
No, he got his from me. All of it!

943
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:28,292
My life was taken away from me
by someone, by everyone in this room.

944
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,500
My life! Do you even know what that means?

945
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,625
Huh?

946
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,417
What Claire's trying to say,
is we're sorry.

947
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,708
We feel bad for you. What do you want?

948
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:41,250
- Are you really asking me that?
- Yes. What do you want?

949
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,542
A check? You want performative pity?

950
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,458
Just tell us the right words
that we can use

951
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,417
so that we can get on with our lives.

952
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,083
You want revenge?
You want to slit Miles' throat?

953
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:56,917
You wanna take us all down?
What? Just drop the bombshell! Say it!

954
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,625
- Say it!
<font color="white">- I want the truth!

955
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:03,083
I want the truth.

956
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,167
I can give you that.

957
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:11,125
I'll be the asshole.

958
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:20,708
The truth is, is that we
are all holding on to that golden tit.

959
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,375
We're all playing
the same game here, honey.

960
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:25,500
You lost.

961
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:29,167
So you can go ahead
and put yourself up on a cross

962
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,750
like some unspeakable crime
has been committed against you

963
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,792
that none of us could possibly imagine.

964
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,042
But me, I'm tired of pretending
like you're the victim in this game.

965
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:43,708
You just couldn't hack it.

966
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:49,500
You're the loser. There. That's the truth.

967
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,417
There she is. There's the Andi I know.

968
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:03,708
Okay.

969
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,917
Oh, jeez, detective.

970
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,250
Your next assignment
is who killed the party.

971
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:11,875
Come on, guys!

972
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:15,458
Blanc ruined my game. It's okay.
Hey, Alpha DJ, give us something upbeat!

973
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:18,167
Miles, I'm gonna be leaving
in the morning.

974
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,042
Yeah, me too.

975
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:24,292
No. No, we're having a champagne brunch
on the beach tomorrow.

976
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,750
You're gonna try foil surfing,

977
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,125
and you're gonna put some aloe on,
work on that tan,

978
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,708
and make your constituents say,
"What was she doing in lockdown?"

979
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:32,417
Birdie, come on, dance with me.

980
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:36,792
Come on, pretty lady, get that smile up.
Come on, come on.

981
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,292
Where's Andi?

982
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,458
Yeah, where is Andi? Come on!

983
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:48,125
Hey. Duke's smiling.
There it is, there's my guy.

984
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,125
What's going on?
You look like you got good news.

985
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,833
I was wondering
why my Googs are blowing up.

986
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:56,500
The views on my channel
are off the charts. You gotta see this.

987
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:57,625
Ooh!

988
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,917
This is all over the Internet.
I mean, look at those numbers.

989
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:04,167
That's fire. That changes things, right?

990
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,500
It sure does.

991
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:09,458
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

992
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,667
You bet your ass. Come here.

993
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,542
- Congratulations.
- Dukey! That's amazing! Let me see!

994
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,250
Everything works out in the end.

995
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,917
You gotta keep the faith.

996
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,708
Guys, have I ever let you down?

997
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:24,125
Have we ever not pulled through?
Pulled it off?

998
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,667
You're staying. Yes?
You're staying. Okay. Love it.

999
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:31,833
Come on, this is our time.

1000
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,250
You feel it? What did we all used to say?
Fake it till you make it

1001
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,583
and have fun while we're doing it.
It's happening.

1002
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,708
We're all changing the world, all of us!
Making a dent in our own ways.

1003
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:47,042
Five minutes ago, Blanc was telling me
that this whole party was a dangerous idea

1004
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:50,708
'cause you all hate me so much
that one of you would actually wanna…

1005
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:55,375
- It doesn't even matter. It's so silly.
- Whoo!

1006
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:58,417
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

1007
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,500
Just… Watch this dress.
Spin that dress again.

1008
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,250
Everybody, Miles says look at me!

1009
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,708
Look at you. She's a bird.

1010
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:10,292
I want a toast.
I want a toast to The Disruptors.

1011
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,792
My OGs. I love you. All of you.

1012
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,667
Disruptors!
Breaking it and making it!

1013
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:22,750
Whoo!

1014
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:25,250
Turn up the music.
We're going in the pool tonight!

1015
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:27,833
We're all starting in the pool tonight.
That's what I want.

1016
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:29,250
Miles.

1017
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,083
On your feet, genius. I wanna see...

1018
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,458
Miles, Duke.

1019
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,333
Whoo!

1020
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:41,792
Jesus.

1021
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:56,958
Duke!

1022
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,125
What… Is he choking?

1023
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:03,500
- Yeah, I think he's...
- No, he's not choking.

1024
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,583
- Okay.
- <font color="white">- You got him?

1025
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,167
- Yeah.
- Duke.

1026
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:12,000
You see anything in there?
No, because I feel like he's…

1027
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,292
What?

1028
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:34,167
I'm afraid Mr. Cody is… is dead.

1029
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,333
No, Duke! No!

1030
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,042
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

1031
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,208
What happened?
Did he choke? What happened?

1032
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,917
There was no obstruction
in his airways.

1033
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,792
But we won't know
the cause of death without an autopsy.

1034
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,167
What just happened?

1035
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,750
My dear, would you do me a favor?
Would you come sit over here?

1036
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,208
Just so I can take care of Mr. Cody.

1037
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:03,917
Yes, that's right. Mr. Bron, would…

1038
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,042
Would you call your boat
and have them come immediately?

1039
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,625
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1040
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:10,917
Mr. Bron!

1041
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,500
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1042
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:17,333
How do I do it?

1043
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:19,833
There's a… There's a radio room,
through there.

1044
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:22,042
You tell them we need
medical personnel and police.

1045
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:22,958
Okay, yeah.

1046
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:26,708
Listen, I must insist
that nobody touch the body

1047
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,667
or disturb anything around it.

1048
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,625
Police?

1049
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,833
Are you treating this
as a crime scene then?

1050
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:38,125
Oh my God. No, wait, wait, this is bad.
I can't. I…

1051
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,583
The police always come. It's protocol.

1052
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,083
I can see the headlines!

1053
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:46,667
"Governor jets off to Greece in a pandemic
with a men's rights YouTuber who dies!"

1054
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,083
Oh my God. No, I...

1055
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,167
Bacardi…

1056
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,750
I think Mr. Blanc's…

1057
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,250
You're not saying
it was done with intention, are you?

1058
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:02,625
Well, we don't know.

1059
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,750
But Mr. Cody's death was
so acute and violent… yes.

1060
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:13,333
My guess is something
was put in his drink, intentionally.

1061
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,875
What do you mean "morning"?
How's that possible?

1062
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,500
<i><font color="white">Pisceshite! Dock is Pisceshite!</i>

1063
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,792
Piece-of-shite. Piece of…

1064
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:33,625
- Boat can't come till low tide in the morning.
- 00 a.m. at the earliest.

1065
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,958
Do they understand the situation?

1066
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,667
There is no other landing point,

1067
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,250
and Miles' dumbass Banksy dock
was set to low-tide height

1068
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,708
and it isn't buoyant.
It is a piece of shit.

1069
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,125
Oh, heck. Yeah, all right, all right. Um…

1070
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,292
I suggest you all retire to your rooms,
lock the doors until 5:30,

1071
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:56,208
when we will convene here
and walk together to the dock.

1072
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:57,833
I'll stay up all night with the body.

1073
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,792
Make sure it's not tampered with
in any way.

1074
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,542
I recommend that everyone gets some sleep.

1075
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,000
Oh!

1076
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,250
That is…

1077
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,708
That's your glass, Miles.

1078
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,292
He…

1079
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,750
He picked up mine.

1080
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,333
He picked up mine.

1081
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,333
He…

1082
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,792
Now we could…

1083
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:40,708
Uh…

1084
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,292
Oh, come on, Miles.

1085
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,125
Miles, it's us!

1086
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,750
Miles, baby, for real?

1087
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:49,000
I'll pay you one billion dollars

1088
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,833
to tell me
<font color="white">which one of them tried to kill me.

1089
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:51,958
- Miles!
<font color="white">- Miles!

1090
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,542
I'm just going to silence Duke's phone.

1091
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,042
We're staying here in this room.

1092
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:02,833
I'm keeping you all in plain sight
until that boat arrives.

1093
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:05,333
- That's what we're doing.
- For God's sakes.

1094
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:10,042
Where's Whiskey? Where's Andi?

1095
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,958
Where's Duke's phone?

1096
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:14,625
It just dinged. It must be here.

1097
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,042
Yeah, I saw it.

1098
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,750
We just heard it.

1099
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,958
It isn't in any of his pockets.

1100
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:23,708
Well, he must have dropped it somewhere.
Let's wait for it to ding again.

1101
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:25,375
Forget about his phone. Look.

1102
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,250
Where is his stupid gun?

1103
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:37,250
Oh, fiddlesticks.
When did his gun disappear?

1104
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,750
He always has his gun.

1105
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,417
Well, he always has it,
which means we stopped seeing it.

1106
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,583
But at some point this evening,
it was gone.

1107
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,625
- When was that?
- Andi.

1108
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,208
We need to find Andi.

1109
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,583
Andi!

1110
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,500
Oh.

1111
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,667
- Mr. Bron!
- <font color="white">- <i>Dong!</i>

1112
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,500
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that hourly dong thing.

1113
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,708
What?

1114
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,917
- Oh, no. No.
- Miles, calm down!

1115
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,333
Oh, shit. Shit.

1116
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,958
- No. It's happening.
- Mr. Bron. What is the matter?

1117
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:10,750
It was the game. The game! My murder game.
We were gonna be having drinks,

1118
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,167
and I thought it'd be fun
to say something dramatic at 10:00.

1119
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,625
We were gonna have
20 minutes where…

1120
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:19,042
Blanc, you have to help me.
You have to help me. Help me! Help me!

1121
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,625
What happens at ten o'clock?

1122
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:34,125
- Birdie, listen to my voice.
- Oh my God.

1123
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,625
- Is that you?
- Stop screaming.

1124
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,958
- Something touched me!
- Do not panic!

1125
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:39,583
- It's so dark.
- I'm here.

1126
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:42,125
- Where's my phone? It has a flashlight.
- I can't see.

1127
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,917
- How does this...
- Lionel!

1128
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,333
- Claire?
- Everybody…

1129
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:46,583
- Over here!
- I'm here!

1130
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:49,583
Stand still. Calm down. Do not panic.

1131
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:53,250
It was Andi! It was Andi.

1132
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:57,167
She killed Duke,
and she tore our room apart. I saw her!

1133
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,917
- What?!
- <font color="white">- Is that a speargun?

1134
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,667
No. Not today!

1135
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,458
Wait, wait, wait.

1136
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,833
- Mr. Bron!
- What the hell is happening?

1137
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:08,542
Oh, hell's bells!
Just, everybody, just stay here!

1138
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,792
Aha! Here's my phone!

1139
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:32,958
Birdie? Lionel? Guys?

1140
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Andi?

1141
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,667
Andi!

1142
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,625
Who's that?

1143
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,667
Oh, Lord help us.

1144
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:13,583
Helen.

1145
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,750
Now listen, did you take Duke's gun?

1146
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,917
Why would I take Duke's gun?
Why are the lights out?

1147
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,333
- Duke is dead.
- What?

1148
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:38,292
I don't understand.

1149
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,000
Please. Trust me. It's all in plain sight.

1150
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,833
We only need one last piece
of information, but only you can...

1151
01:07:58,417 --> 01:07:59,792
Lionel? Lionel?

1152
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,667
Guys? Where are you?

1153
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,375
I'm here! What happened?

1154
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,333
- Did you hear that?
- Guys?

1155
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,542
I heard it from here.
Everybody all right?

1156
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,542
What was that?

1157
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,958
Was that a gunshot?
It sounded like a gunshot.

1158
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:48,917
Oh, God.

1159
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,792
Everyone. Inside.

1160
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,083
- Shouldn't we...
- She's not going anywhere.

1161
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,500
It's time to finish this.

1162
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:19,333
Peg, radio the mainland.
Tell them to send the boats now.

1163
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:22,417
Banksy be damned!
Beach them if they have to!

1164
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:27,250
- She killed Duke. Why would she...
- No.</font>

1165
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,500
It makes no sense.

1166
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,958
It all makes perfect sense.

1167
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,625
Duke, Andi, this weekend,

1168
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:38,458
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1169
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:41,708
Will you explain it to us then, detective?

1170
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:45,208
No, I can peel back the layers,

1171
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:49,750
I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1172
01:09:51,417 --> 01:09:55,458
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1173
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,917
Get that, would ya?

1174
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,375
You're not in the bath again,
are you?

1175
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,708
No!

1176
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,417
Yep?

1177
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:21,792
Uh…

1178
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,375
Can I help you?

1179
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,542
Yes, is this Benoit Blanc's residence?

1180
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,875
Um, what is this regarding?

1181
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:34,250
Well, his office was closed,
and I really need to speak with him.

1182
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,417
It's urgent. Please.

1183
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,833
Blanc! There's someone here for you.

1184
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:43,583
With a box!

1185
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,167
Oh my.

1186
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,625
Well, why don't we start at the beginning?

1187
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:58,208
My name is Helen Brand,
and I came all the way here from Alabama.

1188
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:02,458
Well, what do you do in Alabama?

1189
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:06,333
I teach. Third grade. Do a lot of Zooming.

1190
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,500
We've been getting into tie-dying a lot
and all this pandemic stuff.

1191
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,417
Okay, none of that really matters.

1192
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,625
Mr. Blanc, two days ago,
I received a call.

1193
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,833
My twin sister committed suicide.

1194
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:23,458
<i>In her car.</i>

1195
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:27,583
<i>In her garage.</i>

1196
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,750
<i>With the engine running.</i>

1197
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,542
My sister was Cassandra Brand.
Do you know who she was?

1198
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:45,333
Yes, of course. I'm sorry, you…
I thought you looked familiar.

1199
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,500
Impressive woman, your sister.

1200
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:52,833
You know, she kept a journal
every day of her life

1201
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,625
since she was six years old.

1202
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,667
You know what she called it?

1203
01:11:57,417 --> 01:12:02,292
"Notes For Future Biographers."
Biographers. Plural.

1204
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,792
The girl was six years old.

1205
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:07,333
Then the day after high school,
she shot off to New York,

1206
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:08,708
and she just never looked back.

1207
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,792
You know, when we were kids,

1208
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,792
we goofed together,
and we'd do this character, Rich Bitch.

1209
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:18,375
"Heavens, the dog ate the caviar again."

1210
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,917
Then I hear her doing a talk,
and that's exactly how she sounded.

1211
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,083
Rich Bitch! And I'm like,
"Who are you fooling, girl? Not me!"

1212
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,417
She had the guts and brains
for both of us,

1213
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,625
and I was just happy watching her,
you know?

1214
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:35,417
So you, um… You get the call…

1215
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,917
Yeah, yeah. I get the call and I fly in.
This was yesterday.

1216
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,958
And then I go to Andi's house.
I'm cleaning it out. It's a mess.

1217
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:44,708
All of her books everywhere.

1218
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:47,875
And I'm just thinking about
what was taken from my sister,

1219
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,875
how I wasn't there for her.

1220
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,625
And I'm getting angrier and angrier,
and then I just hear a knock at the door,

1221
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,042
and it's some courier
with this thing from Miles Bron.

1222
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,958
And I'm sure there's
some clever way to open it.

1223
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't know. I just open it.

1224
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,458
And it's an invitation

1225
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,792
to his private island in Greece
for next weekend.

1226
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:10,833
One of those little trips she'd go on
with him and his group of shitheads.

1227
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,708
They like to call themselves
"The Disruptors."

1228
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:19,083
But I knew who they were,
and I told her who they were. Shitheads.

1229
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:26,208
Miss Brand, what can I do for you?

1230
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,750
Andi didn't commit suicide.

1231
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,792
She didn't leave any note.

1232
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,875
So I went on her computer,
and I looked in her email,

1233
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,542
her sent messages,
to see if she wrote anybody anything.

1234
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:44,167
And look. She sent this at 4:00 p.m.,
the day she was murdered, four days ago.

1235
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,667
"I finally found it."

1236
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,083
"It's right here, and I'm going to use it
to burn his whole empire down."

1237
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,875
"I'm giving you all one last chance
to make things right."

1238
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,958
{\an8}"You know where to find me. A."

1239
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,958
And I'm assuming
all of these names here are...

1240
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:05,917
Birdie Jay, Duke Cody,
Claire Debella and Lionel Toussaint.

1241
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,125
The Shitheads.

1242
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,542
She sends that email,
nobody writes back anything,

1243
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,333
and then the next day,
she's dead in the garage

1244
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,125
with sleeping pills in her system?

1245
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,458
I searched every inch
of every room in her house,

1246
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,292
and guess what wasn't there?

1247
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:24,958
The red envelope.

1248
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:28,917
Compelling.

1249
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,625
Google said you are
the world's greatest detective.

1250
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,583
Somebody like me,
takes something like this

1251
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,667
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers...

1252
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,583
But if one was to get 'em alone,

1253
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:44,667
isolated for a weekend with,
in your words,

1254
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,000
the world's greatest detective…

1255
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,375
You wanna hire me to go to that island.

1256
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,042
It's a stupid idea, right?

1257
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:55,167
Listen, I want to be clear, huh?

1258
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:57,292
I am not Batman.

1259
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,875
I can find you the truth,
I can gather evidence,

1260
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:03,292
I can present it to the police
and the courts, but…

1261
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,417
…that is where my jurisdiction ends.

1262
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,167
Yeah, but it's you doing it instead of me.
I'll take those odds.

1263
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,792
I've not seen
your sister's death in the news.

1264
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,250
- Did you release a statement?
- No.

1265
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,833
Shit. Was I supposed to?

1266
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,292
I don't know how this works.

1267
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,833
And you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and…

1268
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:25,250
Oh, if I pulled a few strings,

1269
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:29,000
I could keep it from leaking
to the press for another… week?

1270
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,583
Maybe, that's…

1271
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:32,667
Oh.

1272
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:35,875
No, that's outrageous. That wouldn't…

1273
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:39,042
Well, now…

1274
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,000
Wow. No, that… Yes. Miss Brand.

1275
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:50,042
Any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me

1276
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,667
when you crossed my threshold,
buttress those feelings now.

1277
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,625
Buttress them.

1278
01:15:56,292 --> 01:16:02,083
I am proposing
that you come with me to that island

1279
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,333
as your sister.

1280
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:07,125
As Cassandra Brand.

1281
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:12,458
What? No.
<font color="white">No, no, no, I'm hiring you to go.

1282
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:15,958
I… I'm not… Are you insane?

1283
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,667
Buttress now. Yes.

1284
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,583
A famous detective shows up

1285
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:23,083
and out of the blue,
starts poking the subject of your sister,

1286
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,833
they'll shut up like a clam.

1287
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:30,542
Your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst.

1288
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:32,625
- Oh, no, come on, man.
- Buttress.

1289
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, I'm trying real hard to buttress,
but this sounds nuts.

1290
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,250
But it is the only way that this works.

1291
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:41,750
Look at me.
<font color="white">They'll know instantly that I'm not her.

1292
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,083
You'll cut your hair.
You'll wear her clothes.

1293
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,417
Oh, you really think
I can fit into that shit?

1294
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,042
- And what about my hair?
- I know a guy.

1295
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,333
Now, why would anyone suspect

1296
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:55,625
you showing up, playing your sister,
when they don't know your sister is dead?

1297
01:16:58,792 --> 01:16:59,667
Right.

1298
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,917
They don't know Andi is dead.

1299
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:05,333
So why would they suspect anything?

1300
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:11,375
- And you'll do the inspecting?
- Yes, I will. You just have to be there.

1301
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,958
Mr. Blanc, is… Is this safe?

1302
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,083
No. No.

1303
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,625
One person will know the truth about you.

1304
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,083
From the moment you arrive on that island,

1305
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:28,917
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing.

1306
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:32,458
And they certainly wouldn't hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks.

1307
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:36,708
I'm… I'm a detective, Helen.
I'm not a bodyguard.

1308
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,042
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1309
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:42,250
No.

1310
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:48,125
One of those shitheads killed my sister.

1311
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,167
Do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch?

1312
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,750
Well, my goodness.

1313
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:30,750
I shouldn't be here. This is nuts.
But I'm here. So let's do this.

1314
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:34,000
- Drink?
<font color="white">- You need a drink.

1315
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:36,000
Oh, no, I don't drink.
I'll have some coffee.

1316
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,042
All right.

1317
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,500
Andi's journals.

1318
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:42,375
Good, you keep studying them.
Okay, so… Tomorrow.

1319
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,125
I'll get there early.

1320
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,542
Really lay on some Southern hokum,
get them all off guard.

1321
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:50,167
On the boat… be cold.

1322
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,458
Don't engage in conversation.

1323
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,583
- Okay, I'm not great on boats.
- Oh, you'll be fine.

1324
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:57,083
Just remember, Rich Bitch voice.
Andi posture.

1325
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,667
I have all of her TED Talks on this,
and I've been studying 'em.

1326
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,917
Good.

1327
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,958
- The dog ate the caviar.
- There you go.

1328
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,375
Yeah.

1329
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,958
So, you said

1330
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:11,042
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive.

1331
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,333
Did you find anything?

1332
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:13,625
Yes, I did.

1333
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,167
But motives for each of them
to want Miles Bron dead.

1334
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,083
Now why would they
kill her to protect him?

1335
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,375
I just don't get it.

1336
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:24,167
What about Miles? What if he just did it?

1337
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,375
Well, we can't rule it out,
but Miles Bron is not an idiot.

1338
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:32,375
To risk committing murder
after a very public court case,

1339
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:35,083
with the possibility
of that email of Andi's coming to light,

1340
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,917
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do.

1341
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,292
Especially if someone
was willing to do it for him.

1342
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,417
Come on. Walk me through these journals.

1343
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,000
Okay.

1344
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,208
About ten years ago,
before they all hit it big,

1345
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,833
<i>they used to hang together at this bar.</i>

1346
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,875
<i><font color="white">And Miles was leader of the pack?</i>

1347
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,167
<i><font color="white">No. Andi was.</i>

1348
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,250
<i>They were all friends with Andi.</i>

1349
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,625
<i>Birdie was a washed-up model.</i>

1350
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:00,000
<i>Duke was a nerd
doing video game tournaments.</i>

1351
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,167
<i>Claire just lost a race for city council.</i>

1352
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,292
<i>Lionel was a substitute teacher.</i>

1353
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,542
<i>All of them run aground in their thirties.</i>

1354
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:09,500
<i>But Andi saw their potentials.
She found them all.</i>

1355
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:10,583
- Hi!
<font color="white">- Hey!

1356
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,333
<i><font color="white">Then she found Miles.
Introduced him to the group.</i>

1357
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:14,958
This is Miles.

1358
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,708
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hey, bro.

1359
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:17,833
I love your hair.

1360
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:19,667
<i><font color="white">At first, nobody liked him.</i>

1361
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,917
…outlive the person…

1362
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,125
<i><font color="white">He'd say stuff like…</i>

1363
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:24,458
I want to be responsible for something

1364
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:28,292
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the <i><font color="white">Mona Lisa.</i> Forever.

1365
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:30,708
What does that even mean?

1366
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,292
It just means immortality.

1367
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:35,125
He wants to create something
that feels lasting, that feels...

1368
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:37,792
His first venture was Moviefone
for foot massages.

1369
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,667
- Did it work?
- No!

1370
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,583
Okay, listen, let's just roll with it.

1371
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:44,333
Let's humor him. Let's see where it goes.
Let's see what happens.

1372
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:46,875
- Hey, team.
<i>- </font></i><font color="white"><i>And things started happening.</i>

1373
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:51,667
<i><font color="white">He got Birdie a show
for her designs. It did well.</i>

1374
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,042
<i>Got Lionel published.
Duke set up at Twitch.</i>

1375
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,750
<i>Claire elected locally.</i>

1376
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:58,250
…at you. I love you back!

1377
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:01,000
<i><font color="white">You know, small stuff,
but it happened.</i>

1378
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,375
{\an8}<i>And then the big thing happened.</i>

1379
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,250
What is that you're working on?

1380
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:08,958
<i>♪ He told me ♪</i>

1381
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:11,250
<i>♪ Let the children lose it ♪</i>

1382
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,458
<i>♪ Let the children use it ♪</i>

1383
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:15,417
<i>♪ Let all the children boogie ♪</i>

1384
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,917
So based on the napkin idea,
Andi and Miles created Alpha.

1385
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,375
It blows up.
They bring everyone along for the ride.

1386
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,625
Miles' aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger.

1387
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,917
Cut to two years ago,

1388
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,167
Miles meets
<font color="white">some sketchy Norwegian scientist

1389
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,583
at an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru

1390
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:33,167
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel.

1391
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,542
- Hmm.
<font color="white">- He becomes obsessed.

1392
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,583
And he's willing to give the company's
entire resources to launch this thing.

1393
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:43,042
No.

1394
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:46,667
Andi. Andi, come on. This is it!

1395
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:50,583
No, no, no. This is not a start-up.
This could blow up the world.

1396
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:51,500
Yeah.

1397
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:54,417
No! Literally, Miles.
This could blow up the world!

1398
01:21:55,417 --> 01:22:00,583
The reality-distortion field ends here.
I can't let you do this.

1399
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,208
What… What do you mean you can't let me?

1400
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:05,750
I'll walk.

1401
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,750
And I'll take half the company
to stop you from using it for this.

1402
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,167
And she did it.
And, God, I love that she did it.

1403
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,750
Then she found out Miles
had the lawyers work the contract

1404
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,542
so she was cut out the company completely.

1405
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,375
So she sued over that?

1406
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,833
Her whole case was based on

1407
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:25,250
intellectual ownership
of the company's founding idea.

1408
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,250
Her idea on the napkin.

1409
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,750
Which she didn't keep.

1410
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:33,667
Miles was very excited. He had an idea.

1411
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,625
Uh, so he grabbed a napkin,

1412
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:40,208
and he, uh, he scribbled
something on it to show us.

1413
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:44,167
- That's a lie! Your Honor, it's a lie.
- Order! Counsel, get your client...

1414
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,958
Look me in the eye, Claire!
You know it's a lie!

1415
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,708
It's a lie.

1416
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:53,667
And do you recall, Mr. Cody,
who wrote this napkin?

1417
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,833
Yeah, Miles.

1418
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:57,583
Uh, it was Miles.

1419
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,083
Miles.

1420
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,292
<i><font color="white">This was March.</i>

1421
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,250
<i>And right after the verdict,</i>

1422
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:10,542
<i>Miles suddenly found the napkin
written in his handwriting</i>

1423
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,958
<i>and did all those interviews about it.</i>

1424
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:15,042
<i><font color="white">A bald-faced fabrication.</i>

1425
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:19,083
A damn lie, and it worked.

1426
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:59,333
So… every one of The Disruptors
perjured themselves

1427
01:23:59,417 --> 01:24:02,375
to destroy Andi and shield Miles Bron.

1428
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:06,667
We… You and I,
we need to find out why. Motive.

1429
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,458
Whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder?

1430
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:12,250
And then, this will be tricky,

1431
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:15,625
everyone's whereabouts
on the night of her death.

1432
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:19,667
Who could have been
at Andi's house that night? Opportunity.

1433
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:24,083
- Our suspects, motive, opportunity… Hey!
- Mm-hmm.

1434
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:27,500
- This kinda looks like that <i>Clue</font></i><font color="white"> notepad.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1435
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,125
You must be really great at <i>Clue,</i><font color="white"> huh?

1436
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:32,458
I'm very bad at dumb things.
My Achilles' heel.

1437
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:35,542
Ticking boxes, running around,
searching all the rooms.

1438
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,375
It's just a terrible, terrible game.

1439
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,667
Well, my students love it.

1440
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:45,792
I'm scared.

1441
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,875
I understand.

1442
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,125
This is your last chance to back out.

1443
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:18,792
Oh, God. Boats.

1444
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,000
Ballsy move.

1445
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,625
You shouldn't be here.

1446
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:40,917
Duke and Birdie, I think they're onto me.
Or they were just being assholes.

1447
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,583
Well, that's not mutually exclusive.

1448
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:45,042
Now, look, I suspect,
when we're all settling in,

1449
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47,917
Bron's going to pull me aside
to explain my presence.

1450
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,958
That is your chance to snoop.

1451
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:50,875
Snoop?

1452
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:52,917
Snoop.

1453
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,167
Snooping. Snoop.

1454
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:02,792
Okay, here we go.

1455
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,167
- Hey.
- Hi.

1456
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,125
Andi.

1457
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,333
Yes.

1458
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:21,833
I'm Whiskey. We didn't really meet.

1459
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:25,792
- Are you looking for the pool?
- I am.

1460
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,000
- Do you want to walk?
- Sure.

1461
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:31,292
Do you want this? I'm not into it.
It smells like that guy Derol.

1462
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:34,958
That's a beautiful necklace.
You're a Taurus?

1463
01:26:35,042 --> 01:26:37,333
Yeah. Um, Miles got it for me.

1464
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:41,958
He, um, surprised me for my birthday.

1465
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:44,750
He filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses.

1466
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:45,958
It was very cute.

1467
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:50,458
He's a really good guy. He's complicated.

1468
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:52,875
But…

1469
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,000
I think it's really shitty
what they all did to you.

1470
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,333
And how they all treated you.

1471
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:01,875
I read your court transcripts,
and you got shanked.

1472
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,042
Thanks, Whiskey.

1473
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,083
Yeah, this is my second one
of these things.

1474
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:09,458
We did a yacht thing last year.

1475
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:11,167
Well, that sounds fun.

1476
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,167
No.

1477
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:16,792
I mean, when they're all together,
it's kind of the worst.

1478
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:20,208
Duke just treats me like arm candy,
and they just ignore me.

1479
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:22,333
- Why do you put up with it?
- With Duke?

1480
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:28,208
I'm building my brand, and he's putting me
on his channel more often.

1481
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:32,750
Though, he's leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff.

1482
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,000
If I'm going to go
into politics eventually,

1483
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,667
I don't think
that's a road I wanna go down.

1484
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,500
It's expeditious,
but it's kind of a shitshow.

1485
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:45,042
- Oh, here's the pool.
- I'm gonna walk around a little longer.

1486
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,625
- I'll catch you over there.
- Okay.

1487
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,042
Hey, it's really great
talking to you, Whiskey.

1488
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,042
You too.

1489
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:58,875
<i>Dong!</i>

1490
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,875
<font color="white">Oh my God!

1491
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:02,792
Really.

1492
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:04,792
Asshole.

1493
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,625
Now it's a party.

1494
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,583
I did it. Two weeks ago, I did it.

1495
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,500
You signed off on the power plant.

1496
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:16,458
Yep. When this thing breaks, poof.

1497
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:20,375
My whole base is gone.
The grassroots lefties? Gone.

1498
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,833
I did it too.

1499
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:22,875
Did what?

1500
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,208
I signed off on putting Klear
in a manned mission.

1501
01:28:26,292 --> 01:28:28,625
- The staff doesn't know it yet.
- Oh, God damn it.

1502
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,500
Let's just pray that
Andi was wrong about this Klear stuff.

1503
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,042
No, she was right.

1504
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,333
You put its gas form
into household piping,

1505
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:40,292
there's massive leakage into the air.
The hydrogen particles are too small.

1506
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:41,500
Hydrogen gas?

1507
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,417
Lionel. I sold my soul for this.

1508
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,458
You're telling me that it could literally
turn people's homes into the Hindenburg?

1509
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:57,000
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

1510
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:04,542
There was a time, you know, back when…

1511
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,458
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

1512
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:11,667
He was this little thing in my hand.

1513
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,292
I preferred that.

1514
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,208
Andi! Hi!

1515
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:28,958
Wow! No.
<font color="white">You're really good at this.

1516
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:33,375
This is interesting stuff about Whiskey
and motives for both Lionel and Claire.

1517
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,458
Well done!

1518
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:37,167
Those were motives?
Because I was kind of confused.

1519
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,833
Oh, no, they bet the farm
and will both be ruined

1520
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:41,750
along with Miles if he fails.

1521
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,250
They need to protect him at all costs.

1522
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:46,833
But I can't imagine them killing her.
I just can't.

1523
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:50,500
Think of the crime, the nature of it.

1524
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:55,500
<i>No, they've come to apologize,
to make amends.</i>

1525
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,750
<i>And the murder itself, it's nonviolent.</i>

1526
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:01,917
<i>Gentle even.</i>

1527
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,833
<i>They don't even see her die.</i>

1528
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,292
<i><font color="white">She just goes to sleep.</i>

1529
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,250
No. No.

1530
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,000
They're all more than capable.

1531
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1532
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,333
I thought you said you didn't drink?

1533
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:29,875
Oh, this? This isn't a drink.
This is some funky health stuff.

1534
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,917
No, you give me that.

1535
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,833
That's hard kombucha.
That's Jared Leto's hard kombucha.

1536
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:39,417
What is it that? That's 9% alcohol or so…

1537
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,417
Get off that.
How many of these things you had?

1538
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,083
I don't know, but I feel fine.

1539
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:46,417
Okay? We need to focus.

1540
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,917
We need to focus. We need
to find the O's, the opportunities.

1541
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,125
We got to open them up. It's time to push.

1542
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,750
No, no, no.
<font color="white">We're not pushing anything right now.

1543
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,833
Listen, I feel good.

1544
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:58,333
I think maybe you should lie down.

1545
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,375
- We're running out of time, Blanc!
- Helen!

1546
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,083
Helen…

1547
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,292
Please.

1548
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,917
Think of the danger here.

1549
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,458
You gotta step back
and let me handle this.

1550
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:10,208
Push nothing.

1551
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:15,833
<i><font color="white">They're gonna tell you to stop.</i>

1552
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:19,833
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

1553
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,458
Because as it turns out,

1554
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:26,167
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

1555
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:29,958
But that is what true disruption is.

1556
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:34,208
And that is what unites all of us.

1557
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:37,125
We all got to that line and crossed it.

1558
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:41,792
Andi…

1559
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,333
Wait! Wait.

1560
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,542
Wait? No, you wait!

1561
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,208
That day in court,
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

1562
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,000
What are you doing?

1563
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,000
You want to talk about the email?

1564
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:07,917
Oh.

1565
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:12,958
So now you want to talk about the email?
You didn't even write back.

1566
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,458
I'm a politician.

1567
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,042
I never email anything

1568
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:20,208
that I wouldn't want to see
on the front page of <i>The Times.</i>

1569
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:21,583
That's why I called.

1570
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:26,667
We all did.
<font color="white">Right after we got it, over and over.

1571
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:30,750
You… Your phone was off,
and then the whole next week.

1572
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:32,875
Yeah, I've got a new number.

1573
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,167
And when we couldn't reach you,
I went to your house.

1574
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:40,125
<i><font color="white">Lionel and I got there
at the same time.</i>

1575
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,458
<i>Duke was already there.</i>

1576
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:43,250
- Andi!
- Hey, Andi?

1577
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,375
<i><font color="white">The lights were out.</i>

1578
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,458
<i>I was pounding so hard,
I almost broke it down.</i>

1579
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:47,375
Andi!

1580
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:52,167
We knocked, waited, and called for you,
but after an hour, we left.

1581
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,042
Birdie came back later on to check.
It was the same thing.

1582
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:58,125
- Where the hell were you, Andi?
- What time did you get there?

1583
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,167
I don't know. It was dark.

1584
01:33:01,667 --> 01:33:02,500
And, Duke,

1585
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,167
you were already there?

1586
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,333
He almost got in an accident
on his motorcycle,

1587
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:08,542
he was driving so fast.

1588
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,875
Andi, I almost got pancaked.

1589
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:13,208
Okay, okay. Can you say all that
one more time for me, please?

1590
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:17,958
Look.

1591
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:22,083
I don't know what you're planning
on pulling being here,

1592
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,500
but we need to talk about this.

1593
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,750
If I would've answered
the door that night,

1594
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:32,333
would you have said,
"I'm sorry. I back you with Miles."

1595
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,625
Or were you just showing up

1596
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:38,250
so you could stop me
from using that envelope?

1597
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,208
Something's off.

1598
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:56,167
I don't like it.

1599
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,583
What's she playing at?

1600
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:05,208
<i>Please, keep our water clean. Please…</i>

1601
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:06,292
Blanc!

1602
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,917
<i>Please, keep our water clean.</i>

1603
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,583
That's everything she said, I think.

1604
01:34:11,667 --> 01:34:14,875
I think maybe you should take up drinking.
You're just killing it.

1605
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:20,250
Lionel and Claire were never there alone.
But Duke came early and Birdie came late.

1606
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:22,792
But they could've gotten there early,
killed your sister,

1607
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,917
{\an8}circled away and then waited
for the other to arrive.

1608
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,167
{\an8}Shit.

1609
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,583
{\an8}Something is just teasing the edge
of my brain.

1610
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:33,792
{\an8}This… this case confounds me.
It just confounds me.

1611
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:37,333
{\an8}We don't have a motive
for Duke or Birdie, so...

1612
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:39,958
{\an8}<i>Do either of you two
want to do a session or what?</i>

1613
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,750
<i>I'm on the clock.</i>

1614
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:46,708
No, not right now.

1615
01:34:49,542 --> 01:34:50,542
Maybe later.

1616
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,500
<i>All right. It's your money, not mine.</i>

1617
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:03,333
Ugh. Oh, if I ever meet Jared Leto,
I'm gonna whoop his kombucha-brewing ass.

1618
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:06,042
One number. All his machines.

1619
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,625
Holy shit.

1620
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:14,375
From that afternoon,
just minutes after Andi sent the email.

1621
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,875
Lionel. Lionel faxed it...

1622
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:19,667
Now hold on,
it doesn't necessarily mean he… Get down.

1623
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:22,958
Right now. Go to him.
Do what you gotta do,

1624
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:26,125
push that son of a bitch.
Just get an answer out of him.

1625
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:31,750
Look, babe. We really need this.
So do this for me one last time, okay?

1626
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,583
All right. I love...

1627
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:55,583
Come here.

1628
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:10,500
Are you gonna do it for me?

1629
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:12,250
Mm-hmm.

1630
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,333
Not that.

1631
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,083
- Hmm?
<font color="white">- Huh-uh.

1632
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh, come on, come on.

1633
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:20,042
It's all he wants.

1634
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,625
The YouTube channel's dying.
He needs the exposure.

1635
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:26,958
Just put him on Alpha News, baby.
Just a late-night spot.

1636
01:36:27,042 --> 01:36:30,208
And you know he's earned it.
With what he did.

1637
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:31,500
Listen, listen.

1638
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,875
I am building the future of news.

1639
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:37,292
I can't have
rhino-horn-boner-pill karma in the mix.

1640
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,375
See? See?

1641
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:45,333
Like, he is my loyal friend,
but I can't put him on Alpha News. Okay?

1642
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:57,042
There's no stopping it, Peg.

1643
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:58,833
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

1644
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:00,792
- Peg!
<font color="white">- Don't. Just don't talk to me!

1645
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:03,500
- Wait! Peg!
- <font color="white">- Ten years! Ten years!

1646
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,375
My therapist says
this is a toxic relationship.

1647
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,833
- Don't be like that!
- Don't follow me. Birdie!

1648
01:37:07,917 --> 01:37:09,375
I quit! I quit!

1649
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,667
<i><font color="white">It was a tribute to Beyoncé,

I am going to sign the statement.

1655
01:37:26,917 --> 01:37:28,958
No! That will destroy us.
There's no coming...

1656

We will do what we always do.

1658

Deny, half-apologize,
and then go silent awhile.

1659
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,208
I will handle this. You…

1660
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:42,583
What is this?

1661
01:37:43,417 --> 01:37:44,500
It's my secret phone.

1662
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:48,083
What is this?

1663
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:51,792
An email from the Sweetie Pants contractor
two years ago.

1664
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,625
"Miss Jay, I'm writing to inform you
that the proposed Bangladesh factory

1665
01:37:57,708 --> 01:38:00,583
is notoriously one of the world's
biggest sweatshops."

1666
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:01,833
"Please advise."

1667
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:07,375
And then you replied,
"Sounds perfect. Thanks."

1668
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,792
With your Memoji dabbing.

1669
01:38:15,917 --> 01:38:16,917
Birdie,

1670
01:38:18,917 --> 01:38:23,667
please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make

1671
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:27,000
sweatpants.

1672
01:38:30,167 --> 01:38:32,208
Oh my God.

1673
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:34,667
Miles is going to pay me off.

1674
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,333
He said if I take full responsibility
for the sweatshops,

1675
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:39,667
he'll pay me the value of my shares.

1676
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,917
Thirty million.

1677
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,042
I will do whatever I have to do
to save myself,

1678
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:46,500
and he is my only lifeline.

1679
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:49,417
<i>- Can I have my secret phone back?</i>
<i>- </i><font color="white"><i>No.</font></i>

1680
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,125
This never happens in <i>Clue.</i>

1681
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:54,958
That's because it's a terrible game.

1682
01:38:55,042 --> 01:38:57,125
They all had a motive to protect Miles.

1683
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:59,917
They were all there that night.
So what now, detective?

1684
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,833
The envelope.

1685
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:06,708
Whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect Miles,

1686
01:39:06,792 --> 01:39:08,500
and they wouldn't just destroy it.

1687
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:10,917
They would want him to see
what they'd done for him.

1688
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,875
They brought it here. It's here.

1689
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:16,250
So how are we supposed to find it?

1690
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,792
Well, unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner,

1691
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,958
they won't have an envelope
that size on their person.

1692
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,583
They'll have to hide it in their room.

1693
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:29,542
So, at dinner tonight…

1694
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:32,292
Andi. I'm hoping it's still whiskey soda.

1695
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:35,667
<i><font color="white">You need to keep your head clear
and stay sharp.</i>

1696
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,958
<i>Because you have to find a way.</i>

1697
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:40,583
I want the truth!

1698
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I can give you that.

1699
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:47,000
<i><font color="white">A way that is
so painfully uncomfortable</i>

1700
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:49,375
<i>that nobody will question it
or follow you.</i>

1701
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,042
<i>- Pick a fight. And lose.</i>
- I'm tired of pretending.

1702
01:39:52,125 --> 01:39:54,250
<i><font color="white">We have to find that envelope.</i>

1703
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,750
You're the loser. That's the truth.

1704
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:04,208
There she is. There's the Andi I know.

1705
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,708
He's a son
of a bitch, Whiskey. Leave his ass.

1706
01:40:27,292 --> 01:40:30,542
<i><font color="white">Search their rooms.
Ransack them, fast and thorough.</i>

1707
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:34,167
<i>Don't worry about being neat.</i>

1708
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:05,708
Hey.

1709
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:08,667
Hi. Sorry.

1710
01:41:12,917 --> 01:41:14,500
Want to hang out or…

1711
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:19,375
Damn it.

1712
01:41:21,417 --> 01:41:22,625
What the hell?

1713
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:40,000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1714
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:54,542
Andi?

1715
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,417
<i>Dong!</i>

1716
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,917
I can explain this.

1717
01:41:58,625 --> 01:41:59,542
Huh?

1718
01:42:00,792 --> 01:42:03,125
Wait a minute. Whiskey, is the party over?

1719
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,625
No. No. I left.

1720
01:42:07,042 --> 01:42:08,792
Duke…

1721
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:12,667
I left Duke because I couldn't…
He didn't deserve this.

1722
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:15,208
How am I going to tell his mom?

1723
01:42:15,292 --> 01:42:19,750
Hey, hey, hey. Yes, he did.
Okay? He is a bastard.

1724
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,667
I don't feel sorry for him.

1725
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,792
He deserved what he got,
and you are better off without him.

1726
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:36,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1727
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:37,958
What the fuck?

1728
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:42,458
Please don't kill me!
Oh my God, please don't kill me!

1729
01:42:42,542 --> 01:42:44,625
I'm not trying to kill you,
you crazy bitch!

1730
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:12,792
Andi?

1731
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:17,167
Andi!

1732
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:18,500
Blanc!

1733
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:29,958
Blanc, where are you? Where are you?

1734
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:33,417
Helen! Listen, there's great danger.
Did you take Duke's gun?

1735
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:36,083
Why would I take Duke's gun?
And why are the lights out?

1736
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:37,125
Duke is dead.

1737
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:38,333
What?

1738
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:40,542
No time. Did you find the envelope?

1739
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:43,292
No, I searched every room. It's not there.

1740
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:46,917
Oh, I've been a fool!
There's one more room to search.

1741
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:50,750
They already gave it to Miles.
It's in the Glass Onion.

1742
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:53,458
If I can distract everyone,
and you can get up there and find it...

1743
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:55,750
No, but that doesn't tell us
who gave it to him.

1744
01:43:56,333 --> 01:43:57,958
Blanc, I don't understand.

1745
01:43:58,042 --> 01:44:00,750
Please. Trust me. It's all in plain sight.

1746
01:44:01,542 --> 01:44:04,625
We only need one last piece
of information, but only you can...

1747
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,333
Son of a bitch!

1748
01:44:49,292 --> 01:44:51,250
Blanc, go chase him!

1749
01:44:52,417 --> 01:44:54,250
What are you doing?
Don't let him get away.

1750
01:45:11,792 --> 01:45:13,583
The killer thinks you're dead.

1751
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,625
This is our cover.

1752
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:20,833
I can buy you maybe five minutes alone
in the Glass Onion, but you have to...

1753
01:45:20,917 --> 01:45:23,208
- Give me that.
- You have to find that envelope.

1754
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:24,833
- I will.
<font color="white">- That's it…

1755
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:26,792
Oh, no, give me that. Give me that.

1756
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:29,750
This'll be good.

1757
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,500
Oh. Oh. Oh!

1758
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:37,583
Shitballs!

1759
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:38,750
Blanc…

1760
01:45:41,583 --> 01:45:42,458
Yes.

1761
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:51,875
Oh, God.

1762
01:45:59,792 --> 01:46:00,917
God, Andi.

1763
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:03,792
Everyone, inside right now.

1764
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:06,375
- Shouldn't we...
- She's not going anywhere.

1765
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,417
Inside.

1766
01:46:10,167 --> 01:46:11,917
It's time to finish this.

1767
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:21,208
Shitballs.

1768
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:24,375
It makes no sense.

1769
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,083
This makes perfect sense.

1770
01:46:26,167 --> 01:46:28,458
Duke, Andi, this weekend,

1771
01:46:28,542 --> 01:46:32,333
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1772
01:46:32,417 --> 01:46:34,750
Will you explain it
to us all then, detective?

1773
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:38,500
No, I can peel back the layers,

1774
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:42,958
I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1775
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:48,625
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1776
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:51,583
Who?

1777
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:59,417
Well, I keep returning,
in my mind, to the Glass Onion.

1778
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:06,417
<i>Something that seems densely layered,
mysterious and inscrutable.</i>

1779
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,125
<i>But in fact, the center is in plain sight.</i>

1780
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:10,625
Where? Where?

1781
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:15,042
And that is why
this case has confounded me like no other.

1782
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:20,042
Why every complex layer
peeled back has revealed

1783
01:47:20,125 --> 01:47:25,000
another layer and another layer
and come to naught.

1784
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:28,333
And that was the problem, right there.

1785
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:34,208
<i>You see, I expected complexity.</i>

1786
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:39,792
<i>I expected intelligence.
I expected a puzzle, a game.</i>

1787
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,875
<i>But that's not what any of this is.</i>

1788
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:48,708
<i>It hides not behind complexity,</i>

1789
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:53,042
<i>but behind mind-numbing obvious clarity.</i>

1790
01:47:55,833 --> 01:47:58,167
<i>Truth is, it doesn't hide at all.</i>

1791
01:47:59,792 --> 01:48:01,583
<i>I was staring right at it.</i>

1792
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:19,167
The killer nearly struck
my Achilles' heel.

1793
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:22,292
But thank high heaven, at the last moment,

1794
01:48:22,375 --> 01:48:28,750
I realized what had teased my brain
through this entire case…

1795
01:48:32,042 --> 01:48:33,333
"Inbreathiate."

1796
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:37,500
It's not a word.

1797
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,292
What?

1798
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:42,750
Can we just take a second
and fully inbreathiate this moment?

1799
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:44,625
It's not a real word.

1800
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:47,667
It kind of sounds like one,
but it's just entirely made up.

1801
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,333
Now "reclamation,"

1802
01:48:49,417 --> 01:48:50,500
now, well, that…

1803
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:54,417
That is a word, but it's the wrong word.

1804
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,125
This place is the full reclamation
of everything I've achieved up to now.

1805
01:48:58,208 --> 01:48:59,417
This entire day…

1806
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,667
The predefinite detective.

1807
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:04,208
A veritable minefield of malapropisms…

1808
01:49:04,292 --> 01:49:05,250
The infraction point.

1809
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:07,042
…and factual errors.

1810
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:09,208
Bask in the sun, swim in the Ionian Sea.

1811
01:49:09,833 --> 01:49:11,875
That is the Aegean Sea.

1812
01:49:11,958 --> 01:49:15,042
Oh, yeah, it is. It is.

1813
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:20,250
His dock doesn't float.
His wonder-fuel is a disaster.

1814
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:24,000
His grasp of disruption theory
is remedial at best.

1815
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:27,208
He didn't design the puzzle boxes.
He didn't write the mystery.

1816
01:49:27,292 --> 01:49:32,292
<i>Et voilà!</i><font color="white"> It all adds up.
The key to this entire case.

1817
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:35,125
And it was staring me right in the face.

1818
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:38,792
Like everyone in the world,

1819
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:43,042
I assumed Miles Bron was
a complicated genius.

1820
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:44,292
But why?

1821
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:49,875
Look into the clear center
of this Glass Onion…

1822
01:49:52,542 --> 01:49:54,292
Miles Bron is an idiot.

1823
01:49:56,125 --> 01:50:01,542
Oh, please.
<font color="white">Just tell us who tried to kill me.

1824
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:06,417
Nobody tried to kill you,
you vainglorious buffoon.

1825
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:09,083
Duke took my glass!

1826
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:11,042
That's what you told us he did.

1827
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:15,625
He must've picked it up by mistake,
you told us, right after it happened.

1828
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:19,292
Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, do that again. Watch this.

1829
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:21,333
And after you said those words,

1830
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:24,292
that's what we all remember seeing,
but think!

1831
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:29,292
Ignore his lies, everyone,
and think clearly now.

1832
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:32,292
What did we all actually see?

1833
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:35,208
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

1834
01:50:35,292 --> 01:50:36,333
Just…

1835
01:50:36,417 --> 01:50:40,417
<font color="white">You handed Duke your own glass.

1836
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,875
Clear as crystal.
Right in front of our eyes.

1837
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:46,667
All of us.
<font color="white">And then told a bald-faced fabrication.

1838
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,625
And it worked.

1839
01:50:49,208 --> 01:50:51,583
Blanc, are you telling us
Miles killed Duke?

1840
01:50:51,667 --> 01:50:53,625
- Yes.
<font color="white">- Why?

1841
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:56,292
Because the night
Andi sent you all the emails,

1842
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:59,042
when Duke got to Andi's house
early on his motorcycle…

1843
01:51:01,417 --> 01:51:03,042
…<i><font color="white">he saw Miles leaving.</i>

1844
01:51:06,958 --> 01:51:08,333
<i><font color="white"> Was almost struck by him.</i>

1845
01:51:08,417 --> 01:51:12,042
<i>In fact, he told all of us.
Right out in the open, he told us.</i>

1846
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:13,542
Iconic.

1847
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:17,292
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of Andi's?

1848
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:19,250
Anderson Cooper's birthday? Mm-hmm.

1849
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,833
That night, at Andi's.

1850
01:51:22,417 --> 01:51:25,583
That night, Duke told us
he almost got in an accident.

1851
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:27,083
He… pancaked?

1852
01:51:27,167 --> 01:51:30,250
Yeah, but Miles had been living in Greece
the past six months.

1853
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,125
No. Whiskey.

1854
01:51:33,417 --> 01:51:36,458
Miles saw you
on your birthday in New York.

1855
01:51:36,542 --> 01:51:40,125
Gave you that necklace for your birthday.
And you're a Taurus.

1856
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:42,208
I am.

1857
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:44,875
Two weeks ago.

1858
01:51:44,958 --> 01:51:47,125
- Forget the hydrofuels…
- May 9th.

1859
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:48,125
…and the sweatshops,

1860
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:51,167
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments.

1861
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,083
Sorry, what?

1862
01:51:52,167 --> 01:51:53,333
And focus

1863
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,292
on the envelope.

1864
01:52:04,542 --> 01:52:06,792
Holy shit!

1865
01:52:10,875 --> 01:52:12,917
What is reality?

1866
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:15,292
Andi?

1867
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,458
Who did the envelope threaten?

1868
01:52:24,542 --> 01:52:25,667
Miles Bron.

1869
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:33,917
<i>That night, Lionel faxed Andi's email
to Miles who received it in New York.</i>

1870
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:37,917
<i>The one thing that could destroy
his empire of lies,</i>

1871
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:42,792
<i>the truth in the hands
of the only person unafraid to tell it.</i>

1872
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,458
<i>So Miles drives his Baby Blue Porsche</i>

1873
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:50,708
<i>to the scene of the crime,
and Andi lets him in.</i>

1874
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:51,917
<i>Of course she did.</i>

1875
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,833
<i>Miles' machine of lawyers and power</i>

1876
01:52:54,917 --> 01:52:58,167
<i>could destroy her
through sheer dumb force.</i>

1877
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,792
<i>But Miles himself?</i>

1878
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:02,250
<i>Oh, she was clever enough
not to fear Miles.</i>

1879
01:53:03,917 --> 01:53:10,208
<i>But she didn't see the real threat,
the obvious threat until it was too late.</i>

1880
01:53:20,292 --> 01:53:24,208
Duke alone knew you were there that night,
but he didn't know Andi was dead.

1881
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:27,750
No, no, he didn't know that
until this evening.

1882
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:32,000
Right here,
<font color="white">when he got a Google Alert on his phone,

1883
01:53:32,083 --> 01:53:35,125
which has now fallen strangely silent.

1884
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,000
And which he showed to you…

1885
01:53:39,292 --> 01:53:41,458
…because you don't own a phone.

1886
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:43,750
Duke! No!

1887
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:50,375
Did he really think
he could stop all of them

1888
01:53:50,458 --> 01:53:52,208
from finding out about Andi's death?

1889
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:53,958
They all have phones.

1890
01:53:54,042 --> 01:53:55,458
- Where's my phone?
- Peggy.

1891
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:57,792
- Phone!
<font color="white">- Still no.

1892
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,417
He didn't need to hide the death.

1893
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,167
He just needed to hide
that Duke had shown him the death

1894
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,542
<i>moments before he was killed.</i>

1895
01:54:06,542 --> 01:54:08,542
<i>Right out in the open, Duke showed him.</i>

1896
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,333
That changes things, right?

1897
01:54:10,417 --> 01:54:11,833
It sure does.

1898
01:54:11,917 --> 01:54:15,000
And told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence.

1899
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:18,375
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

1900
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:21,208
You bet your ass. Come here.

1901
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:23,542
So what does Miles do?

1902
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:25,750
Does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something?

1903
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:26,917
Is that a rich person thing?

1904
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,667
No, no, no, no, it's just…
It's so much stupider than that.

1905
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:34,667
Birdie, what are the ingredients
to your Cuban Breeze?

1906
01:54:35,292 --> 01:54:38,208
Um, vodka, amaretto.

1907
01:54:38,292 --> 01:54:39,125
Oh, God.

1908
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:46,708
<i><font color="white">And… pineapple juice.</i>

1909
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:49,458
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

1910
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:51,208
An allergy.

1911
01:54:51,292 --> 01:54:52,792
He can't even have a drop.

1912
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,333
Pineapple juice!

1913
01:54:54,833 --> 01:54:58,042
He just put
<font color="white">pineapple juice in his whiskey.

1914
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,375
It's so dumb.

1915
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,792
Oh, it's so dumb, it's brilliant.

1916
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:05,667
No! It's just dumb!

1917
01:55:06,542 --> 01:55:09,917
"Died of an apparent suicide.
She is survived by her sister, Helen."

1918
01:55:11,208 --> 01:55:12,083
Helen.

1919
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,500
You told me about Helen, your sister...

1920
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,917
Oh, wait!

1921
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:24,292
Helen Brand, ladies and gentlemen.

1922
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,417
And now we come
to Helen's attempted murder,

1923
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:36,750
which, I have to give you credit for,
did have a sound foundation of thought.

1924
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:41,333
You realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you.

1925
01:55:41,417 --> 01:55:43,333
You have a house on a remote island,

1926
01:55:43,417 --> 01:55:46,333
<i>filled with desperate people,</i>

1927
01:55:46,417 --> 01:55:51,333
all of whom have a real-life reason
to wish this woman harm. You...

1928
01:55:56,167 --> 01:56:02,500
Furthermore, you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach.

1929
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:08,917
And the lights had even been turned off.

1930
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,500
You've taken seven people,

1931
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:13,208
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

1932
01:56:13,292 --> 01:56:15,583
gathered them together on a remote island,

1933
01:56:15,667 --> 01:56:19,125
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

1934
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:23,167
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

1935
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:26,167
Heavens to…

1936
01:56:27,292 --> 01:56:29,750
You dim-witted, brainless

1937
01:56:30,417 --> 01:56:31,833
jackass!

1938
01:56:32,958 --> 01:56:36,667
Your one murder, with any panache at all,

1939
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:41,458
and you stole the whole idea from me.

1940
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,958
And after all that, you…
You still kept the envelope?

1941
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:02,500
You didn't burn it or anything?

1942
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,500
You recognize this?

1943
01:57:06,625 --> 01:57:08,333
Andi's handwriting.

1944
01:57:09,667 --> 01:57:11,167
I got you, son of a bitch.

1945
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,542
Oh, let's slow down there, sister. Okay?

1946
01:57:14,625 --> 01:57:18,375
Because first, how could you
ever prove that that's the original?

1947
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:20,125
- She might have copied mine.
- No.</font>

1948
01:57:21,042 --> 01:57:23,542
The bar closed nine years ago,

1949
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:26,625
and hers has one thing
that yours just doesn't.

1950
01:57:34,583 --> 01:57:36,875
Okay, but second…

1951
01:57:45,917 --> 01:57:48,292
- What the hell did he do?
- He just burned it!

1952
01:57:48,375 --> 01:57:50,375
Burned what?
I didn't see anything.

1953
01:57:50,458 --> 01:57:51,417
You burned it!

1954
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:54,042
- Is someone making toast?
- This will not stand.

1955
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:59,708
Uh-huh. Well, did you see this proof,
this smoking napkin, Blanc?

1956
01:58:01,167 --> 01:58:03,333
No. Did anybody?

1957
01:58:08,583 --> 01:58:10,208
Okay, then wow!

1958
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:13,750
Wow! We got some big accusations
flying around here.

1959
01:58:14,458 --> 01:58:16,542
Except, everybody seems to have

1960
01:58:16,625 --> 01:58:19,125
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw,

1961
01:58:19,208 --> 01:58:22,542
and there's nothing
but totally circumspective evidence.

1962
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:27,542
So, if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game,

1963
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:30,083
which we should have been doing
all weekend,

1964
01:58:30,167 --> 01:58:33,583
then Blanc wins an iPad Pro this time.

1965
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:36,000
But this is the real world.

1966
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:40,375
And in the real world, you need
more than a neat, little detective story.

1967
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:41,958
You need evidence.

1968
01:58:42,042 --> 01:58:45,167
And you've got… nothing.

1969
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:46,875
Do you?

1970
01:58:54,417 --> 01:58:55,417
He's right.

1971
01:58:57,250 --> 01:59:00,250
The contents of that envelope
and his possession of it

1972
01:59:00,333 --> 01:59:02,583
were our only physical evidence.

1973
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:05,458
Right.

1974
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:12,125
Wanna take that to the cops?
You wanna take it to the courts?

1975
01:59:13,458 --> 01:59:15,667
Look, you pick your poison.

1976
01:59:16,292 --> 01:59:20,417
Anywhere you go,
it's going to be your word against mine.

1977
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,917
How do you think that's gonna go?

1978
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:27,417
I think it's gonna go
about like it went for Andi.

1979
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,917
Jesus.

1980
01:59:31,542 --> 01:59:33,667
And, I do want to say,

1981
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:38,333
your sister was a complicated woman,
but she meant the world to me.

1982
01:59:39,792 --> 01:59:41,375
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

1983
01:59:50,917 --> 01:59:52,167
Nobody's stepping up?

1984
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:58,583
Raise your hand
and say, "I saw him take Duke's gun."

1985
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:04,417
"I saw him that night at Andi's house."

1986
02:00:10,292 --> 02:00:12,542
"I saw the napkin before he burned it."

1987
02:00:13,333 --> 02:00:14,208
We didn't…

1988
02:00:16,792 --> 02:00:18,000
We… We didn't.

1989
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,417
You would lie for a lie,
but you won't lie for the truth.

1990
02:00:26,333 --> 02:00:28,583
You're still holding on to his titties.

1991
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,583
You shitheads.

1992
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:38,250
Blanc.

1993
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:41,708
I need you to do something.

1994
02:00:44,292 --> 02:00:46,125
I'm sorry, Helen.

1995
02:00:46,792 --> 02:00:48,333
I gave you the truth.

1996
02:00:49,583 --> 02:00:51,875
This is where my jurisdiction ends.

1997
02:00:53,042 --> 02:00:56,375
I have to answer to the police,
the courts, the system.

1998
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,417
There's nothing I can do.

1999
02:01:04,917 --> 02:01:05,958
Except maybe…

2000
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:09,917
offer you some courage.

2001
02:01:13,083 --> 02:01:17,167
And a reminder of why your sister
walked away in the first place.

2002
02:02:31,167 --> 02:02:32,292
Hell, yeah!

2003
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:38,375
Why the hell not?

2004
02:02:38,458 --> 02:02:40,833
Yeah, go, Helen! All right, go, Helen!

2005
02:02:46,083 --> 02:02:48,292
[music ends abruptly

2006
02:02:54,708 --> 02:02:56,417
God damn, that felt good.

2007
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,917
Oh, really?

2008
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,833
- You want to join in?
- Yeah.

2009
02:03:04,917 --> 02:03:05,833
- Oh, yeah.
<font color="white">- You go.

2010
02:03:05,917 --> 02:03:07,333
Yeah, we should… Hey, Miles!

2011
02:03:13,875 --> 02:03:14,708
Okay.

2012
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:25,417
I get it, guys. Let it all out.

2013
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,167
Yes! Whoo!

2014
02:03:34,458 --> 02:03:36,458
Yay! Mazel tov!

2015
02:03:41,292 --> 02:03:43,250
Ooh, coming in real hot.

2016
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,958
Helen, easy!

2017
02:03:45,917 --> 02:03:46,833
Whoa!

2018
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:50,083
I think that belonged to Liberace.

2019
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:52,250
Okay, I… Are we done?

2020
02:03:54,958 --> 02:03:56,000
Whoa, whoa.

2021
02:03:56,083 --> 02:03:58,000
- We're not done.
- Whoa, whoa.

2022
02:04:00,083 --> 02:04:00,958
Why are you...

2023
02:04:01,042 --> 02:04:01,917
Ooh.

2024
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,750
Okay. What?

2025
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:13,125
What? What is it? What do you want?

2026
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:21,917
We're not...

02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:39,917
- Fire extinguisher?
- Wait...

2032
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,875
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

Okay, stop!

2037
02:04:56,333 --> 02:04:58,208
Stop. Enough.

2038
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:10,583
Helen, walk away.

2039
02:05:11,875 --> 02:05:13,125
Yeah.

2040
02:05:13,208 --> 02:05:16,458
