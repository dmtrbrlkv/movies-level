00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,200
Good afternoon.

161
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,480
Skip to the end!

162
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,560
See these? These are my
wilderness explorer badges.

163
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
You may notice one is missing.

164
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,920
It's my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

165
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,960
If I get it, I'll become a
senior wilderness explorer!

166
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,600
The wilderness
must be explored!

167
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
It's gonna be great!

168
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,760
There is a big ceremony
and all the dads come and...

169
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,440
we pin on our badges...

170
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,280
- So you wanna assist an old person.
- Yeah!

171
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,080
Then I'll be a senior
wilderness explorer!

172
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,440
- Have you ever heard of a "snipe"?
- "Snipe"?

173
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,040
A bird. Big eyes.

174
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,320
Every night it
sneaks into my yard

175
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,560
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

176
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,440
I'm elderly and infirm.

177
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,040
I can't catch it.

178
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,840
- If only someone could help me...
- Me, me, I'll do it!

179
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,080
I don't know, it's
awfully crafty.

180
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,240
You'd have to clap
your hands three times

181
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
to lure it in.

182
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,720
I'll find her,
mr. Fredricksen!

183
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I think its burrow
is two blocks down...

184
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,240
Two blocks down. Got it!

185
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Bring it back here
when you find it!

187
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,320
Snipe!

188
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,800
And stop. Stop. Stop!

189
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,040
Hey, hey!

190
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,120
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

191
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,600
I am so sorry, sir.

192
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,040
Don't touch that!

193
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,360
No, no, no, let me take
care of that for you.

194
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,480
Get away from our mailbox!

195
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,480
- Sir...
- I don't want you to touch that!

196
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,720
It looks bad.

197
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,040
<i><b>COURT SUMMONS</b></i>

198
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,480
Sorry, mr. Fredricksen.

199
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
You don't seem like
a public menace to me.

200
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Take this.

201
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,040
The guys from "Shady Oaks" will be
by to pick you up in the morning, ok?

202
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
What do I do now, Ellie?

203
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
Good morning, gentlemen.

204
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,760
Good morning, mr. Fredricksen.

205
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
You're ready to go?

206
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,360
Ready as I'll ever be.

207
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
Would you do me the
favour and take this?

208
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,240
I'll meet you in the
van in just a minute.

209
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,840
I... wanna say one last
goodbye to the old place.

210
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
Sure. Take all the
time you need, sir.

211
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,960
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

212
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,760
You'd think he'd take
better care of his house.

213
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,200
So long, boys!

214
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,160
I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

215
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
<i><b>SOUTH AMERICA</b></i>

216
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,960
We are on our way, Ellie.

217
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Hi, mr. Fredricksen.

218
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960
It's me, Russell.

219
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,360
What are you doing
out here, kid?

220
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,880
I found the snipe and I
followed it under your porch.

221
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,320
But this snipe had a long tail

222
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,120
and looked more
like a large mouse.

223
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
Please, let me in.

224
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,560
No.

225
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,200
Aw, all right. You can...

226
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,280
come... in.

227
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,840
I've never been in a
floating house before.

228
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,640
Goggles...
Look at this stuff!

229
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Are you going on a trip?

230
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,800
"Paradise Falls, a
land lost in time".

231
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,880
Are you going to South
America, mr. Fredricksen?

232
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
Don't touch that!
You'll soil it.

233
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You know, most
people take a plane.

234
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,200
But you're smart,

235
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,160
because you have your
TV, clocks and stuff.

236
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
Ooo, is this how
you steer your house?

237
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Does it really work?

238
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,280
This makes it turn right
and that way is left.

239
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
Hey, look! Buildings!

240
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,720
That building's so close,
I can almost touch it!

241
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,120
Wow, this is great!

242
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
You should try this,
mr. Fredricksen.

243
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

244
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,920
Hey, I can see your
house from here!

245
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Don't jerk around
so much, kid!

246
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,280
Well, that's not gonna work.

247
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,520
I know that cloud,
it's a "cumulonimbus".

248
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,680
Did you know that
a cumulonimbus...

249
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,760
Aaa, I stayed up all night
blowing up ballons... for what?

250
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,680
That's nice, kid.

251
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,120
What are you doing over there?

252
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Look!

253
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,600
See? Cumulonimbus.

254
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,920
My bag!

255
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,080
Got you!

256
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Uuu, I thought you were dead.

257
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,320
What happened?

258
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,440
I steered us. I did
it! I steered the house.

259
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,880
You steered us?

260
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,440
After you tied your stuff
down, you took a nap.

261
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,640
So I went ahead and
steered us down here.

262
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,160
Yeah, sure.

263
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,720
I can't tell where we are.

264
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,440
O, we're in South
America all right.

265
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,120
It was a singe. I used my
wilderness explorer GPS.

266
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,280
GP... what?

267
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,720
My dad gave it to me.

268
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,080
It shows exactly where
we are on the planet.

269
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,640
With this baby
we'll never be lost!

270
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,360
Ups.

271
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,920
We'll get you down,
find a bus stop,

272
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,080
and you'll just tell the man you
want to get back to your mother.

273
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,560
Sure, but I don't think they
have buses in Paradise Falls.

274
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,600
There, that ought to do it.

275
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,840
There, I'll give you some
change for the bus fare.

276
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,400
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

277
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,400
It's just gonna be like a billion
passes to get back to my house.

278
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,440
Mr. Fredricksen,
how much longer?

279
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,880
Well, we're up pretty high.

280
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,280
It'll take hours to get down.

281
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,600
I think that was a
building or something.

282
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,160
What was that,
mr. Fredricksen?

283
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,800
We can't be close
to the ground yet.

284
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Wait, no, no!

285
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,160
Wait, wait!

286
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,000
Hang on!

287
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,720
Pull back!

288
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,320
Where... where are we?

289
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,360
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, mr. Fredricksen.

290
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,160
Don't worry,
Ellie. I've got it.

291
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,520
There it is!

292
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Ellie, it's so beautiful!

293
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,520
We made it!

294
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,080
We made it! Russell, we
can float right over there.

295
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,000
Climb up, climb up!

296
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,120
Do you mean... assist you?

297
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
- Yeah, whatever.
- Ok, I'll climb up!

298
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,280
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

299
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,480
When you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up.

300
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,280
Got it?

301
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,520
Are you on the porch yet?

302
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,560
What? That's it?

303
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,000
I came all this way here to get stuck
on the wrong end of this rock pile?

304
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,160
Ah... great.

305
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Hey, if I could assist
you over there...

306
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,120
would you sign
up for my badge?

307
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,560
What are you talking about?

308
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,640
We could walk your
house to the fall.

309
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,560
- Walk it?
- Yeah.

310
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,200
After all we weigh it down, we
could walk it right over there.

311
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
Like a parade balloon.

312
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,360
Now, we'll walk to the
falls quickly and quietly,

313
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,560
with no rap music
or flash dancing.

314
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,040
We have three days at best till the
helium leaks out of those balloons.

315
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
And if we are not at the
falls when that happens...

316
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,280
we're not getting
to the falls.

317
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,480
There... I found sand!

318
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,640
Don't you worry, Ellie.

319
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,800
We'll get our
house over there.

320
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,000
It is fun already, isn't it?

321
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,800
By the time we get there,

322
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,280
You're gonna feel so
assisted... Oh, mr. Fredricksen,

323
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,480
if we happen to get separated,

324
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,640
use the wilderness
explorer call.

325
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Wait, why are we going
to Paradise Falls, again?

326
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,240
Hey, let's play a game.

327
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,760
It's called: "See who
can be quiet the longest".

328
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,000
Cool! My mom loves that game!

329
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,600
Darn thing...

330
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,720
Come on, Russell, hurry it up.

331
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,600
Ah, I'm tired.

332
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,680
My knee hurts.

333
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Which knee?

334
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,880
My elbow hurts and I have
to go to the bathroom.

335
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,360
I asked you about
that five minutes ago.

336
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,880
I didn't have to go then!

337
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,320
I don't wanna walk anymore...

338
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,280
Please, stop...

339
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,800
Russell, if you don't hurry
up, the tigers will eat you.

340
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,440
There are no tigers
in South America.

341
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,440
Zoology.

342
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,520
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on
into the bushes and do your business.

343
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,040
Ok. Here! Hold my stuff!

344
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,760
I've always
wanted to try this.

345
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,120
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose
to dig the hole before or after?

346
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,280
That's none of my concern.

347
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,240
Oh, it's "before"!

348
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
Tracks?

349
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
Snipe.

350
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,600
Here, snipe.

351
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,640
Come on out, snipe.

352
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,960
Snipe!

353
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,880
Got you. Don't be
afraid, little snipe.

354
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,640
I am a wilderness explorer,

355
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,480
so I'm a friend
to all of nature.

356
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,040
Want some more?

357
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,320
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.

358
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,120
Come on out.

359
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,440
Come on. Come on...

360
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,880
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

361
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,320
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.

362
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,600
Nice giant... snipe!

363
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,680
I found the snipe.

364
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,240
Oh, did you?

365
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,960
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes. They're very tall.

366
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,480
Do they have a lot of colors?

367
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,960
They do, indeed.

368
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,360
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yeah...

369
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,520
Chocolate?

370
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,680
What is that thing?

371
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
It's a snipe.

372
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,200
There no such
thing as a snipe!

373
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,040
But you said...

374
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,680
Go on, get out of here! Go!

375
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,240
Careful, Russell.

376
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,640
Look, mr. Fredricksen,
he likes me.

377
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,040
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles!

378
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,640
Get out of here!
Go on! Get!

379
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,920
No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.

380
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,040
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

381
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,480
- Kevin?
- Yes, that's the name I just gave him.

382
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,760
Bit it, boo, scram!

383
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,840
Hey, that's mine!

384
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,520
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

385
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,680
Go on, bit it!

386
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,520
Can we keep him? Please?

387
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,040
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

388
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,960
No.

389
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,640
An explorer is
a friend to all,

390
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,600
be it a plant, a
fish or a tiny mole.

391
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,920
That doesn't even rhyme.

392
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Yeah, it does.

393
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,640
- Hey, look, Kevin.
- What?

394
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,480
Hey, get down from there!
You're not allowed up there!

395
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,120
You come down here right now!

396
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,280
Can you believe this, Ellie?

397
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,200
Ellie?

398
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,520
Hey, Ellie, can
I keep the bird?

399
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,000
Aha.

400
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,680
She said for you to let me.

401
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,960
But I told him
no. I told you no.

402
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,240
N
- o!

403
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,680
I see you, back there.

404
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,800
Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

405
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,520
Hey, are you ok over there?

406
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,840
Hello?

407
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,400
Oh, hello, sir.
Thank Goodness.

408
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,240
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

409
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
I can smell you.

410
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,080
What?

411
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,800
You can... smell us?

412
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,520
I can smell you.

413
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,440
- Hey!
- You were talking to a rock.

414
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,520
Hey, that one
looks like a turtle.

415
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
Look at that one! That
one looks like a dog!

416
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,400
- Ah, it is a dog.
- What?

417
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,200
We're not allowed to have
dogs in my appartment.

418
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,720
Hey, I like dogs!

419
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,080
We have your dog!

420
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,720
- I wonder whom he belongs to.
- Sit, boy.

421
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,440
Hey, look, he's trained!

422
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Shake.

423
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,240
Aha. Speak.

424
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
Hi, there.

425
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,800
Did that dog just
say "Hi, there"?

426
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,640
Oh, yes!

427
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,920
My name is Dug. I just
met you and I love you.

428
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,680
My master made me this collar.

429
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,000
He is a good and smart master
and he made me this collar

430
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,440
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

431
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,880
My master is good and smart.

432
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,120
It's not possible.

433
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,040
It is because my
master is smart.

434
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,960
Hey, cool! What
do these do, boy?

435
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,600
<i>Would you cut...</i>

436
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,840
<i>I'd use that collar... I
would be happy if you stopped.</i>

437
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,960
Russell, don't touch that.

438
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,840
It could be...
radioactive or something.

439
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,120
I am a great tracker. My master
sent me on a special mission.

440
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,520
All by myself. Have
you seen a bird?

441
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,800
I want to find one and
I've been on a scent.

442
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

443
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,560
Hey, that is a bird. I have
never seen one up close,

444
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,000
but this is the bird.

445
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,240
May I take your bird up
to camp as my prisoner?

446
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,720
Yes, yes, take it.

447
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,920
And on the way, learn how
to bark like a real dog.

448
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,600
I can bark.

449
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,680
And here's howling.

450
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,920
Can we keep him, please?
Please, please, please?

451
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,160
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

452
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,200
It's just a weird
trick or something.

453
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
Let's get to the fall.

454
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:52,200
Please, be my prisoner! Oh,
please oh, please, be my prisoner!

455
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Oh, here it is! I picked
up the bird's scent!

456
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. What is this?

457
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,440
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

458
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,400
I'm getting prunes
and ginger cream.

459
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,640
Who are they?

460
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,200
Oh, man, the master
will not be pleased.

461
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,920
We'd better tell him someone
took the bird, right, Alfa?

462
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,800
No.

463
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,640
Soon enough the bird
will be ours again.

464
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Find the scent, my compadres,

465
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,040
and you, too, shall have
much rewarding from the master

466
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,880
for the toil that you did.

467
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,200
Hey, Alfa, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

468
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,040
You must have broken it.

469
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,040
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.

470
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,160
Beta, Delta!

471
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,320
Perhaps you
desire... Squirrel!

472
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,760
Perhaps you desire to
challenge the right that

473
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,160
I have been assigned by
my strength and cunning.

474
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,360
No, no. No.

475
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,160
But maybe Dug would.

476
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,960
You might wanna ask him.

477
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,760
I wonder if he's found the bird
on his "very special mission".

478
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,800
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

479
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,160
His fool's errand will
keep him most occupied...

480
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,480
Most occupied, indeed.

481
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,000
Do you not agree with that
which I'm saying to you now?

482
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,760
Sure. But the second the master finds
out that you sent Dug out by himself,

483
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,840
none of us will get a treat.

484
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,960
You're unwise, my
trusted lieutenant.

485
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,400
This is Alfa. Calling
Dug. Come in, Dug.

486
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,800
<i>Hi, Alfa. Your
voice sounds funny.</i>

487
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,040
I know, I know!

488
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,600
Have you seen the bird?

489
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,680
<i>Oh, yes. The bird
is my prisoner now.</i>

490
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,840
Yeah, right.

491
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,600
Impossible. Where are you?

492
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,640
<i>I am here with the bird
and I will bring it back</i>

493
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,280
<i>and then you like
me. Oh, gotta go.</i>

494
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,040
<i>Dug, who are you talking to?</i>

495
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,000
- Wait, wait!
- What is Dug doing?

496
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,960
Why is he with
the small mailman?

497
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,000
Where are they?

498
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There he is.

499
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,000
Come on!

500
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,040
Please, oh, please,
be my prisoner.

501
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,480
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

502
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,320
That man over there
says I can take the bird.

503
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,120
And I love that man there
like he is my master.

504
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,200
I am not your master!

505
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,880
I am warning you
once again, bird!

506
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,800
- Hey, quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird!

507
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,960
At this rate we will
never get to the falls!

508
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,520
I am nobody's master, got it?

509
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,760
I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!

510
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,280
I'm stuck with you!

511
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,280
If you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

512
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,320
A ball! Oh, boy,
oh, boy, a ball!

513
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,240
Ball? You want a ball?

514
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,880
Yes, I do! I ever
so want the ball!

515
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,600
Go get it!

516
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh, boy, I will get it
and then bring it back!

517
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,560
Quick, Russell, give
me some chocolate.

518
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,040
- Why?
- Just give to me!

519
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,840
Bird! Bird!

520
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Come on, Russell.

521
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,320
Wait! Wait, mr. Fredricksen!

522
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,720
What are you doing?

523
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,760
Hey, we're pretty far now.

524
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,680
Kevin's gonna miss.

525
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,720
I think that did the trick.

526
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,280
Hi, master.

527
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,640
Afternoon.

528
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,720
Well, thanks for keeping
us dry, anyway, Ellie.

529
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,200
Which one is the front?

530
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,760
Well, boy...

531
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,160
Is this step
three or step five?

532
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,320
There.

533
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,560
All done. That's for you.

534
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,280
Well, tents are hard.

535
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,080
Wait, aren't you
super wilderness guy

536
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,560
with the GPS and the badges?

537
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,280
Yeah, but...

538
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,400
Can I tell you a secret?

539
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,320
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

540
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,760
I never actually built a
tent before. There! I said it.

541
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,720
You've been camping
before, haven't you?

542
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,680
Well, never outside...

543
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,040
Well, why didn't you ask
your dad how to build a tent?

544
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,080
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

545
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,920
Try him sometime, maybe
he'll surprise you.

546
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,280
He's away alot, I
don't see him much.

547
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,880
He's gotta be home sometime.

548
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,040
I call, but Phyllis told
me I bug him too much.

549
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,080
Phyllis? You call your own
mother by her first name?

550
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,680
- Phyllis isn't my mom.
- Oh!

551
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,240
But he promised he'd come
to my Explorers Ceremony

552
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,920
to pin on my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

553
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,200
So he can show me how
about the tent then, right?

554
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,120
Hey, why don't
you get some sleep?

555
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,920
We don't want to wake the
travelling flea circus.

556
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he
wants to take Kevin prisoner.

557
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,560
We have to protect him.

558
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,960
Can Kevin go with us?

559
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,480
All right, he can come.

560
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,760
Promise you won't leave him?

561
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
Yeah.

562
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,800
Cross your heart?

563
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,040
Cross my heart.

564
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,760
What have I got
myself into, Ellie?

565
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,800
Good morning, sweetheart.

566
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,840
We'd better get moving.

567
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,640
The bird's gone. Maybe
Russell won't notice.

568
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,720
All right, everybody up!

569
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,360
Where's Kevin?
He's wondered off!

570
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,600
- Dug, find Kevin! Kevin!
- Find the bird, find the bird!

571
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,520
Point!

572
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,440
Oh, look! There he is...

573
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,800
Point!

574
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,800
Hey, that's my roof!
Get off my roof!

575
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,440
Yeah, get off of his WROOF!

576
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,760
What is he doing?

577
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,920
The bird is calling
to her babies.

578
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,200
Her babies!

579
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,320
Kevin is a... girl?

580
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,000
Her house is over there,
on those twisty rocks.

581
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,280
She's been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

582
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,240
Wait, Kevin is just leaving.

583
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,120
But you promised
to protect her.

584
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,200
Her babies need her. We gotta
make sure they're together.

585
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,120
Sorry, Russell. We've
lost enough time already.

586
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Yeah...

587
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,680
It was her favorite chocolate.

588
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,520
Because you sent her
away, there's more for you.

589
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,120
Kevin?

590
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,800
Where's the bird? You
said you had the bird!

591
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,880
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
If I had said that,

592
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,960
I can see how you
would think that.

593
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,040
Where is it?

594
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and
then I will again have the bird. Yes.

595
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,960
You lost it. why do I not
have a surprised feeling?

596
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,640
Well, at least you now
have led us to the small

597
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,320
mailman and to the one
that smells as prunes.

598
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,080
The master will be most
pleased we have found them.

599
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,680
He will ask them
many questions. Come.

600
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,400
Wait! We're not
going with you.

601
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,960
We're going to the fall.

602
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,040
Get away from me!

603
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,680
Down!

604
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,360
You came here... in that?

605
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,720
Yeah.

606
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,360
In a house? A floating house?

607
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,240
That is the darnest
thing I've ever seen!

608
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,120
You're not after
my bird, are you?

609
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,360
But if you need to borrow a cup
of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!

610
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,760
Well, this is all
a misunderstanding.

611
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,720
My dogs made a mistake.

612
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,640
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

613
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,440
Well... yes.

614
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,480
The Charles Muntz?

615
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Adventure's out there!

616
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,200
It's really him!

617
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,360
That's Charles Muntz!

618
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,440
It is?

619
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,200
Who's Charles Muntz?

620
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Him!

621
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,160
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans.

622
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,280
Oh, well, you're a
man of good taste.

623
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,400
Now you must be tired. Hungry?

624
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,200
Atention, everyone! These
people are no longer intruders.

625
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,920
They are our guests.

626
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,720
Yeah!

627
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,040
All right! I like
you temporarily.

628
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,960
I will not bite you.

629
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,800
The small mailman
smells like chocolate!

630
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,040
I'm sorry about the dogs,

631
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,480
I hope they weren't
too... rough on you.

632
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,560
Go ahead and pull your
airship right next to mine.

633
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,120
We are not actually going inside
the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?

634
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Oh, would you like to?

635
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,600
Would I?

636
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,440
Wait up, mr. Muntz!

637
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,920
Jiminy Cricket!

638
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,000
- Not you!
- What do we do with Dug?

639
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,440
He lost the bird. Put him
in "the cone of shame".

640
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,840
I do not like "the
cone of shame".

641
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,000
Most of the collection is housed
in the world's top museums:

642
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,280
New York, M?nich, London.

643
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,840
Of course, I kept
the best for myself.

644
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,520
Did you ever. Look at that!

645
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,120
Oh, yes. The Arseloterium.

646
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,880
The beast charged while
I was brushing my teeth.

647
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,040
I used my shaving
kit to bring it down.

648
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,520
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.

649
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,800
The only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time was

650
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,000
to have it declared
technical weapon.

651
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,480
Oh, my Gosh! The giant
Somalian Labradodis!

652
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,840
Oh, you recognize
it? I'm impressed!

653
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,160
There's an interesting
story there.

654
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,400
Excellent choice.

655
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,600
I found it on safari,

656
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,160
with Roosevelt.

657
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,920
He and I fell into a habit of
playing Gin Rummy in the evenings

658
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,080
and did he cheat!

659
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,240
He was horrible.

660
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,960
Master, dinner is ready.

661
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,360
Oh, dear, broken translator.

662
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,080
I think it's that
loose wire again.

663
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,160
- There you go, big fellow.
- Thank you, master.

664
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,400
I liked his other voice.

665
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,480
Well, dinner is served.

666
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,960
Right this way.

667
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,800
So, how are
things States side?

668
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,800
Almost tempted to
go back a few times.

669
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,160
But I have
unfinished work here.

670
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,760
Please! I hope you're hungry.

671
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,120
Because Epsilon is the
finest chef I've ever had.

672
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,600
Epsilon, you've done it again!

673
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Yeah!

674
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,080
Hey! Hey!

675
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,560
My Ellie would have
loved all these.

676
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,920
You know, because of
you she had this dream

677
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,440
to come down here
and live by the fall.

678
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,920
I'm honored. And
now you've made it.

679
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,600
You sure we're not a
bother? I'd hate to impose.

680
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,840
No, no, it's a
pleasure to have guests.

681
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,440
A real treat.

682
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,640
Treat?

683
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,800
Where's my treat?
I want my treat!

684
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,360
Hey!

685
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,800
I shouldn't have
used that word.

686
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,040
Having guests is a delight!

687
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,680
More often I get thieves trying
to steal what is rightfully mine.

688
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,840
No...

689
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,840
They called me
a fraud, those...

690
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,080
But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.

691
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,360
Beautiful, isn't it?

692
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,200
Oh, I've spent a
lifetime tracking it.

693
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,680
Sometimes, years go by

694
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,480
between seeings.

695
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,360
I've tried to smoke it out of
that death land where it lives.

696
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,600
Can't go in after it.

697
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,440
Once in, there's no way out.

698
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,600
I lost so many dogs.

699
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,280
Here they come tnose bandits who
think the bird is theirs to take!

700
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,760
is a very dangerous place.

701
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,520
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

702
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,440
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!

703
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,280
I trained it to follow us.

704
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,520
Follow you?

705
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,480
Impossible. How?

706
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,440
She likes chocolate.

707
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,360
- Chocolate?
- Yeah.

708
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,720
I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes wild about it.

709
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,400
But it ran off.

710
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,080
Let's go now.

711
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,280
You know, Carl...

712
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,760
these people who
pass through here

713
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,960
A surveyor making a map...

714
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,160
a botanist
cataloguing plants...

715
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:00,640
an old man taking his
house to Paradise Falls.

716
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:11,320
That's the best one yet, I
can't wait to hear how it ends.

717
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,360
Well, it's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

718
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,280
You're not leaving.

719
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,640
We don't want to take
advantage of your hospitality.

720
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,840
Come on, Russell.

721
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,800
But we haven't even
had dessert yet.

722
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,360
Oh, the boy is right.

723
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,920
You haven't had dessert.

724
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,360
Epsilon here makes a
delicious cherries jubilee.

725
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,440
You really must
stay! I insist!

726
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,240
We have so much
more to talk about!

727
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,640
Kevin?

728
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,880
It's near.

729
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,720
Get them!

730
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,640
- Hurry!
- Kevin!

731
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,000
Hurry! Dogs! Hurry!

732
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,920
Master! Over here!

733
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,360
Here!

734
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,920
Go on, master!

735
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,760
Left!

736
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,760
Russell!

737
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Get back!

738
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,280
Go on, master! I
will stop the dogs!

739
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,080
Stop, you, dogs!

740
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,640
Help!

741
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,640
Give me your hand!

742
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,360
Hang on to Kevin!

743
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,320
Kevin!

744
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,200
No, no, no. Kevin...

745
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,960
Stay down.

746
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,520
She's hurt real bad.

747
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,920
Can't we help her get home?

748
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,520
All right. But we gotta hurry.

749
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,320
- You lost them?
- No, it was Dug.

750
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:36,720
Yeah, he's with them.
he helped them escape!

751
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,520
Wait. Wait a minute.

752
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,640
Dug.

753
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,480
- See anything?
- No, my pack is not following us.

754
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,120
Boy, they are dumb!

755
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,920
This is crazy.

756
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,520
I finally meet my chidlhood
hero and he's trying to kill us.

757
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,920
- What a joke.
- Hey, I know a joke!

758
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,720
A squirrel walks up
up to a tree and says:

759
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,240
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead".

760
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,960
It is funny because
the squirrel gets dead.

761
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,440
Careful, Russell.

762
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,960
You ok, Kevin?

763
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,920
You know what,
mr. Fredricksen?

764
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,000
The wilderness isn't
quite what I expected.

765
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,880
Yeah? How so?

766
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,320
It's kind of... wild.

767
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,440
I mean, it's not how they
made it sound in my book.

768
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,640
Get used to that, kid.

769
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,800
My dad made it sound so easy.

770
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,920
He is really good at camping,

771
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,960
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff...

772
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,280
He used to come to all
my squad lodge meetings.

773
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,360
And afterwards, we go
get icecream that fattens.

774
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,480
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

775
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,360
Then we sit on this
one curve, right outside

776
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,960
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones

777
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,640
and whoever gets
the most wins.

778
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,040
I like that curve.

779
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,400
It might sound boring,

780
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,280
but I think the boring stuff is
the stuff I remember the most.

781
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,160
Look, there it is!

782
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,560
Hold on, Russell, stand still.

783
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,200
Look at that bird go! Wait
up, you overgrown chicken!

784
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,440
That's it! Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

785
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,080
Run, Kevin, run!

786
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,880
Oh, no!

787
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,440
Russell, d?-mi cu?itul t?u!

788
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,720
Get away from my bird!

789
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
No!

790
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,960
No!

791
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,840
Careful, I want it in good
shape for my retirement.

792
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,160
Let it go!

793
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,000
Stop!

794
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,640
Kevin!

795
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,960
You gave away Kevin.

796
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,120
You just... gave her away.

797
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,600
This is none of my concern.

798
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,040
I didn't ask for any of these!

799
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,200
Master, it's all right.

800
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,840
I am not your master!

801
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,040
If you hadn't shown up, none
of these would have happened.

802
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,680
Bad dog, bad dog!

803
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,920
Whether you assist me or not,

804
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,400
I am going to Paradise
Falls, if it kills me!

805
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,840
Here.

806
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,040
I don't want this anymore.

807
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,920
Russell?

808
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,160
- Russell!
- I'm gonna help Kevin

809
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,920
even if you won't!

810
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,680
No, Russell, no!

811
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,240
Russell?

812
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,440
I was hiding under your
porch because I love you.

813
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,000
Can I stay?

814
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,200
Can you stay? Well,
you're my dog, aren't you?

815
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,720
And I'm your master.

816
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,200
You're my master?

817
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,880
- Oh, boy!
- Good boy, Dug!

818
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,800
You're a good boy!

819
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,440
Yes!

820
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,320
Don't worry, Kevin,
I'll save you.

821
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,760
And they wouldn't believe me.

822
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,600
Just wait till they
get a look at you!

823
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,440
Master.

824
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,440
The small mailman
has returned.

825
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,240
What?

826
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,920
Let me go!

827
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,640
Where is your elderly friend?

828
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,560
He's not my friend anymore.

829
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,200
If you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

830
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,440
Where are you keeping Kevin?

831
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,920
Let me go!

832
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,080
Scream all you
want, small mailman.

833
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,320
None of your mailmen
friends can hear you.

834
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:35,120
I will unleash all my
wilderness explorer training!

835
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,640
Alfa, Fredricksen
is coming back!

836
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,880
Guard that bird.

837
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,040
If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

838
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,160
Where are you going? I'm
not finished with you!

839
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,720
Nice talking with you.

840
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,160
Where are you, Fredricksen?

841
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,000
Help!

842
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,320
Russell!

843
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,920
- Dle Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

844
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,040
You came back for
Kevin! Let's go get her!

845
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,160
I'm getting Kevin.
You stay here.

846
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,560
- But I wanna help!
- I don't want your help.

847
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,360
I want you safe.

848
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,200
How do we get pass these dogs?

849
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,480
Point!

850
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,280
Kevin!

851
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Don't worry, Kevin.
We are on our way.

852
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,000
No one should be enterring
through these doors.

853
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,280
Guard well that
bird, my minions.

854
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,560
What do we do now, Dug?

855
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,000
Who wants the ball?

856
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,080
Me, me, me!

857
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,840
Go get it!

858
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,160
I got it!

859
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,520
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's
get you out of here.

860
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,880
- Master, he's gone.
- What's going on?

861
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,280
- He's got the bird!
- He ran off!

862
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,160
Calm down! One at the time!

863
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,960
I want to... help!

864
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:19,240
Does anybody know
where they are?

865
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,640
Rais leaders! Bring
down that house!

866
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,520
Raid leader! Checking in!

867
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,080
- Raid two, checking in.
- Raid three, checking in.

868
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,360
Target sighted.

869
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,600
Come on, Kevin.

870
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,640
Hi.

871
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,400
Any last words, Fredricksen?

872
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,880
Come on, spit it out!

873
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,320
Come on!

874
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,720
Enough!

875
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,160
You cannot leave
this place alive!

876
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,600
You're dead!

877
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,240
Come on, Kevin.

878
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,680
I'll have plenty of enjoyment
for what I'm about to do to you.

879
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,960
He wears the cone of shame!

880
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,000
Not just continue
sitting! Atack!

881
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,760
No! No! Stop your laughing!

882
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,840
Listen, you, dog, sit!

883
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,520
Yes, Alfa.

884
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,600
Alfa? I am not
Alfa, he is... Oh!

885
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,440
I can't do it.

886
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,320
Russell...

887
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,800
You leave mr.
Fredricksen alone!

888
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,960
- Hey! Squirrel!
- Squrrel? Where?

889
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,480
I hate squirrels!

890
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,720
- Dug!
- Master!

891
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,960
Russell, over here!

892
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:17,200
Let's go!

893
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,000
Mr. Fredricksen!

894
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,280
Come on, Kevin.

895
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,280
No!

896
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,360
Russell, get out of there!

897
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,880
Leave them alone!

898
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,880
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go! Grab on to him!

899
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,280
Kevin! Cihcolate!

900
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:46,360
That was cool!

901
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,280
Don't jerk around
so much, kid.

902
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,680
Easy, Russell.

903
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,880
Oh, I am ready
to not be up high.

904
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,040
Sorry about your
house, mr. Fredricksen.

905
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,280
You know... It's just a house.

906
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,040
Look at you! You're so soft!

907
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,200
I wish I could keep one.

908
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,720
Where is my cane?
I just had it here.

909
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,720
You know what? Keep them. A
little gift from me to you.

910
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,560
Bye, Kevin!

911
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,720
- Ready?
- Ready.

912
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,960
By receiving these badges,
the following explorers

913
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,920
will graduate to
Senior Explorers.

914
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,200
For Extreme
Mountaineering Lore.

915
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,440
Congratulations, Jimmy.

916
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,440

Defensive Arts,

917
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,880
Congratulations, Brendan.

918
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,320
For Assisting the Elderly...

919
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,080
Russell.
Is there someone...

920
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,840
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

921
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,280
I'm here for him.

922
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,960
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

923
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,560
Russell, for
assisting the elderly

924
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,280
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

925
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,840
I would like to award you the
highest honor I can bestow.

926
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,360
<i><b>"The Ellie badge".</b></i>

927
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:29,080
I think that covers everybody.
so let's give a big exlorer call

928
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,320
to our brand new Senior
Wilderness Explorers!

929
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,720
Ready everybody?

930
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,760
- Blue one.
- Red one.

931
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,040
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

932
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,280
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

933
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,440
- It's red, isn't it?
- Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating!

934
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:59,080
- No, I'm not. Red one.
- That's a fire hydrant.

935
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,320
Maybe I need a few lessons.

936
