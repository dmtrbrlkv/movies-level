1
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:11,767
Hi, everyone. I'm Taika Waititi.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,772
Welcome to my commentary
for <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>

3
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:22,027
Um, I'm joined by no one
because they're all too lazy to help.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,364
So, uh... Well, actually, you know what?
That's not true. My daughters are here.

5
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,199
They're somewhere upstairs,

6
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:33,205
running, uh, amok
here at Abbey Road in London.

7
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:38,919
Famous Abbey Road, where, um,
the Spin Doctors made all their hits.

8
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,921
Now, I'm also just in this moment...

9
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,632
I just thought... I just thought of
having some glasses of water,

10
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,218
and I thought,
I'll just add some of my own little...

11
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,387
[glasses clinking]

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,973
Some little wind chimes
just from some glasses.

13
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:54,893
You can do this at home if you want.
Just pour water into glasses and just...

14
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:57,980
[glasses clinking]

15
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:01,400
And you want to
change the tone, you just... [smacks lips]

16
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:04,111
- ...drink some of the water.
- [glasses clinking]

17
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:10,075
Michael Giacchino
did the, uh, score to this film.

18
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,203
[glasses clinking]

19
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:17,958
- [taps on solid surface]
- [glasses clinking]

20
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:22,796
I think it would have been better
with some glasses of water.

21
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:28,927
[chuckles]

22
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:32,306
<i>I'm tired.</i>

23
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:38,687
[Waititi] Christian Bale, scabby.
Look at him.

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,355
Scabby and sunburnt.

25
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:42,941
So this girl... Here's a spoiler.

26
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,027
Uh...

27
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:48,405
She's not actually dead. She's an actor.

28
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:51,199
That is Chris Hemsworth's daughter.

29
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:53,952
Christopher Hemsworth,

30
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:57,956
who plays the titular character
of Thor in this film.

31
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,710
Shocker!

32
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,878
Look at that.

33
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:05,130
So, um, we thought, you know,

34
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:09,051
we've promised a big, bombastic,
sparkly, colourful film

35
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,969
full of fun and entertainment.

36
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:15,432
[voice whispering] <i>You have suffered.</i>

37
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,101
<i>Come to me.</i>

38
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,271
<i>Come to me.</i>

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,238
[Waititi] Because the fun
is about to start.

40
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,824
But, you know,
first we want to establish the villain

41
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:34,826
and what he, uh...
what he's going through.

42
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:36,995
I love this villain.

43
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:43,752
Gorr, based on Gorr the God Butcher
from the comic run, uh, <i>God Of Thunder.</i>

44
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:46,880
<i>God of Thunder.</i> That's right.
Came to me. <i>God of Thunder.</i>

45
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:54,763

<i>Ah, what do we have here?</i>

52
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:34,678
[Gorr grunting]

53
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,639
[Waititi] Uh, this is my friend,
Jonathan Brugh.

54
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:39,057
Jonny Brugh from New Zealand.

55
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:44,271
He plays Deacon in the hit movie
I also made, <i>What We Do in the Shadows.</i>

56
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,022
You'll remember him.

57
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,609
He's not this muscly in real life,
and he's not golden.

58
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:51,278
He, um...

59
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:55,699
We did all of that to him, uh,
with computers and CGI.

60
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:58,535
<i>The land is dry.</i>

61
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,704
<i>All life is lost.</i>

62
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:03,498
[glasses clinking]

63
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,837
[Waititi] A little bit more wind chimes
'cause I think it's appropriate here.

64
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,089
<i>Is this why you celebrate?</i>

65
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:13,341
[Waititi] Um, fun fact.

66
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,469
That's Christian Bale
from <i>Empire of the Sun.</i>

67
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:19,514
<i>Empire of the Sun.</i> You remember that?
He's that little kid in that.

68
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,475
<i>No. No, sorry.</i>

69
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,852
<i>There's no eternal reward for you, dog!</i>

70
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,440
<i>What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.</i>

71
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:31,526
<i>We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword...</i>

72
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,111
- [voice] <i>You have suffered.
- ...before he could harm</i>

73
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,739
<i>- any other gods with that cursed blade.</i>
- [voice] <i>if it's revenge you seek.</i>

74
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,074
<i>He threatened to end my entire empire.</i>

75
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:40,118
<i>But, my lord...</i>

76
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:45,874
[Waititi] And now, this is the moment
when we figure out that Gorr

77
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,795
has been betrayed by his gods.

78
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,424
Now, what we've created with Gorr
is a sympathetic character,

79
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:56,134
a sympathetic villain,

80
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,721
in that you don't necessarily
have to agree

81
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,890
with what he's doing
throughout the movie,

82
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,351
but you do understand why he's doing it.

83
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:09,231
You understand the anger
behind his drive.

84
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:14,569
And this is where he finds out
that the gods, they laugh at us.

85
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,030
We are mere playthings to the gods.

86
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:20,617
"As flies to wanton boys," if you will,
if you like Shakespeare.

87
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:24,996
If you're one of those weird old people
who love Shakespeare.

88
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,081
Oh, no!

89
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,500
Look at that. Being lifted up.

90
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,295
And Jonny Brugh, I can tell you
right now, is also not that tall.

91
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:36,842
Or maybe he is that tall
and Christian Bale is very short.

92
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,136
Here we go. This is it.

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,641
This is when the, uh, black evil sword
named the Necrosword...

94
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:49,729
Another fun fact. Hela, played by
Cate Blanchett in, uh, <i>Thor: Ragnarok...</i>

95
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:52,691
If you like the comic books
with God the Gorr Butcher,

96
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:55,110
then you will recognise
that Hela's sword...

97
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:59,739
Hela's sword, yes, indeed,
is the Necrosword.

98
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:03,285
So there's some sort of link
between the two there, isn't there?

99
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:06,371
Or we decided that the sword
looked cool and just gave it to Hela

100
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:08,290
'cause we didn't know
if we would make another movie.

101
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,044
Uh-oh. He's killed his first god.
Butchered his first god.

102
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:16,756
[Rapu] <i>The sword chose you.</i>

103
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,093
[Waititi in mocking voice]
"The sword chose you."

104
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,637
"Oh, no, Gorr cursed!"

105
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,766
[normal voice] Oh, look at that.
He's cursed. Look at those black veins.

106
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:31,396
You'll notice there that that god, Rapu,
he bleeds gold.

107
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,523
All gods bleed gold.

108
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,484
That's what we establish in this film.

109
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:38,486
Oh, and all gods will die.

110
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,572
Chop. Thud!

111
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,325
Beheaded. Look at that. Arty shot.

112
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:45,035
And then we fade out,

113
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:51,917
and then we got Michael Giacchino
to redo the wonderful Marvel fanfare,

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,337
because this film
is a bit rock and roll, man.

115
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,301
It's, uh... We're embracing the wonders
of the electric guitar

116
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,638
and all things '80s rock.

117
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,475
[Waititi vocalises to soundtrack]

118
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:13,146
<i>L can't believe</i>
<i>We made another Thormovie</i>

119
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,857
<i>Yes, whoa, yes, we did</i>

120
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,277
<i>We, we will never stop</i>

121
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:22,447
Marvel stud-ios.

122
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:26,117
Oh, your favourite character, Korg,

123
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:28,453
introducing the film,
narrating the film.

124
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:32,332
There he is. Look at him
talking to a bunch of Smurfs in a cave.

125
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,836
Those, uh, creatures are called
the Indigarrians

126
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,339
and were not based on the Smurfs.

127
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:44,886
But it turns out you can't make anyone
blue without thinking about Smurfs.

128
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,306
That baby... interesting fact

129
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,770
that you probably don't care about...
Uh, that is, um, Brian Chapek's baby.

130
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:58,066
Brian, um, is one of the producers
on the film.

131
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,988
That shot of him smiling
was from <i>Thor 1</i> by Kenneth Branagh.

132
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:08,743
That's his wife. That's Elsa Pataky.

133
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:10,495
I don't know who the wolf is,

134
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:13,498
but that's Chris and Elsa
actually making out.

135
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:17,794
- Ooh, this is wind chime time.
- [glasses clinking]

136
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,380
Romantic.

137
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:24,801
That's from <i>The Dark World</i>
by Alan Taylor.

138
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:27,679
I made the job easier on myself

139
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,390
by using other people's footage
from other people's films.

140
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:32,142
That's from my film.
That's from my film.

141
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,352
That's from my film.
That's from my film.

142
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:37,939
That's from some Russos film.
That's from Branagh's film.

143
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:39,774
That's from Alan Taylor's film.

144
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:41,484
That's from, uh, the Russos' film.

145
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,278
I could name all the shots.
That's from my film!

146
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,946
The best one of all.

147
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,197
[Korg] <i>"What have I done?"</i>

148
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,491
[Waititi] "What have I done?"

149
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:51,327
This is from the Russos' film.
You remember this one. <i>Endgame.</i>

150
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,246
[Korg] <i>And so he hid his heart</i>
<i>behind a big, fleshy bod</i>

151
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,874
<i>so it could never be broken again.</i>

152
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,419
[Waititi] So this montage, we came up
with this idea for this five years ago.

153

[Waititi]
Here's the Guardians of the Galaxy.

164
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:35,789
Chris Pratt.

165
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,836
No notes about Chris Pratt. Just like
saying the words "Chris Pratt."

Get your hands off the glass.

You're putting fingerprints

Just talking to my kids.

169

Um, there he is. Chris.
God, he's beautiful.

170
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:55,016
Is that an eyelash on his cheek?
That's annoying.

171
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:59,604
This here is a little nod to...

172
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:04,984
whatever kind of witch...
wizardly witch thing

173
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:08,154
you ever wanted to be acknowledged
in a Thor film.

174
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,365
Some would say Harry Potter. No.

175
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,452
I say <i>Bad jelly the Witch.</i>
It's a story by Spike Milligan.

176
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,414
If you don't know who he is,
then you need to read more books.

177
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:26,506
Okay. These creatures here are based on
the gang from the original <i>Mad Max</i> film.

178
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,886
And so that main guy, uh, the big white
tuft of hair, that main owl guy,

179
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,807
he's based on Toecutter,
the leader of the gangs in <i>Mad Max.</i>

180
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,978
And George Miller,
greatest filmmaker alive, apart from me,

181
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:43,148
he came to visit my set and, um,
I got to show him that

182
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:44,232
and, um, I just...

183
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:48,111
I wanted him to know that, yeah, he's
a huge influence on me, old Georgie,

184
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:51,322
and, um, I wanted to pay
a bit of homage to him.

185
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:52,574
Because we're in Australia,

186
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:55,034
and what better way to pay homage
to anyone in Australia

187
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,662
than to reference <i>Mad Max?</i>

188
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:59,205
More Smurfs.

189
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:03,084
So this guy here, King Yakan...

190
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,337
<i>Yes, it's very nice.</i>

191

<i>- But then our gods were murdered.
- Murdered?</i>

193
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,930
He, um... Stephen Curry.

194
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:20,059
Stephen Curry. Not Stephen.
That's not Stephen Curry, guys.

195
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:22,937
Stephen Curry's
the taller one behind him.

196
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:27,025
Um, no, Stephen is, um, in one
of the best Australian comedies

197
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:29,903
called... that's right... <i>The Castle.</i>

198
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,656
Um, he's the one who starts
the whole film off by saying,

199
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,576
"My name's Dale Kerrigan,
and this is my story."

200
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,788
Just a little... little nod to that film.

201
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,457
Lots of things
I've ripped off from people

202
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,167
I'm acknowledging at the same time.

203
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,544
They mean the same thing,
"ripping off" and "acknowledging."

204
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:48,922
It's a sign of, uh, respect.

205
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,258
"Here and now." Okay, cool.

206

- Uh-oh. Needle drop.

On their bikes.

214
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,990
Here comes the first battle of the film.

215
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,660
Go, Chris, go. Go, Chris, go.

216
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:23,039
And this is not Chris.
That's a stunt double called Bobby.

217
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,124
There's Chris.

[Waititi vocalising

219
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:33,424
So, uh, <i>Appetite For Destruction</i>

220
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:36,511
was, uh, one of the first albums
I ever bought when I was a kid.

221
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:39,931
Loved Guns N' Roses ever since. Um...

222
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:46,354
No owl... humanoid owls
were destroyed or hurt

223
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,606
in the making of this film, by the way.

224
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,442
Um, and, uh, I have loved Guns N' Roses
ever since.

225
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:54,529
Decided to put, uh, them in this film,

226
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:58,574
and I don't even want to know
how much money that cost.

227
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:01,452
Destruction.
I've got an appetite for it.

228
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:05,540
Okay, here's a cool part of the film.
One of my favourite parts, actually.

229
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:09,252
Check this Van Damme...
Look at this Van Damme nod.

["Welcome to the Jungle"

231
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:23,016
There's Van Damme doing the splits,
but we just stuck Chris's face on him.

232
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:26,769
And stuck my muscles
on Chris's arms. Yeah!

233
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,148
And jumpy jump.

234
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:33,318
I know everything that happens
in this movie. I've seen it 500 times.

235

Whoo, dodge. Triple kick.

Bang, bang.

237
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,032
That's another...

238
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:42,410
We completely ripped off that from
another Jean-Claude Van Damme move.

<i>He's not going to go into

[Waititi vocalises end of song]

242

Now, see that background there? That was
all shot on a thing called The Volume.

243
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,975
If you've watched <i>Mandalorian,</i>
which I also directed a little bit of,

244
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,687
um, you'll know that
that's a big LED screen, okay.

245
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:12,565
It's made of... of hundreds of TVs,
all created...

246
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:15,943
all, like, stuck together
in a big circular room, 360 degrees,

247
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,529
with a ceiling made of TVs as well.

248
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:19,947
A lot of TVs.

249
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:23,659
And, um, that's how
you get those backgrounds.

250
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,328
And that's actually there
when you're shooting,

251
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:28,456
and actually all the...
the environments that you see on there

252
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,793
also are in the reflections
of the things that you're shooting.

253
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,128
And all the actors get to see
what they're looking at,

254
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:37,673
to see the environment they're in,
and also it lights the scene as well.

255
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:41,010
And it's extremely expensive.

256
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:43,721
Here's Natalie Portman

[Waititi] This reference here
is from, um, <i>Event Horizon.</i>

273
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,300
My very good friend Sam Neill, who's
also in the movie, you'll see him soon.

274
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:24,095
So he's the first one to do this little
pen through the paper thing.

275
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:25,805
Then Nolan ripped that off.

276
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:28,558
Hey, it's filmmakers.
We're all ripping each other off.

277
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:32,895
Um, so he did that thing, uh...
in, um, <i>Interstellar</i>

278
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:37,358
And, um, now I've, uh, re-ripped it off
and put it in <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>

279
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:40,570
I hope someone rips this off
and puts it in.

280
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:44,449
Hopefully, they rip off Kat Dennings's
little noise that she made just there.

281
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,741
That little...

282
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,953
[lips flapping]... noise.

283
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,581
Um, little bit of, uh,
product placement there.

284
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,416
All backwards and unreadable.

285
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,503
In the form of delicious chips.

286
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,883
Or, if you're from
the weirder parts of the world,

Stage Four?

289
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,765
Uh-oh. This movie's getting depressing.

290
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:14,479
Uh, this whole storyline,
with Jane having the old big C,

291
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:17,398
is from the comic run <i>The Mighty Thor,</i>

292
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:24,405
which is where this whole thing
with Jane's character, um, comes from,

293
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:28,868
and I think it's one of the greatest,
uh, comic runs ever, really.

294
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:31,954
It's an incredible, uh,
use of Jane's character

295
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:36,292
and she's, um,
challenged with this disease,

296
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,629
but also is able to, you know,
eventually... spoiler...

297
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,048
lift up Thor's hammer
and become a superhero herself.

298
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:45,468
It's a fantastic story,
and I urge you all to read it.

299
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:46,886
Um...

300
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,055
[whispers] Ripped it off,
put it in the movie.

301
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:54,018
[normal voice] So, anyway,
big fan of Natalie.

302
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:55,520
I've loved watching Natalie

00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:57,355
and I've been an admirer of hers
for many years.

304
00:16:57,438 --> 00:17:00,608
And this is our first, uh,
outing together,

305
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:03,444
treading the old cinematic boards.

306
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:05,905
So I think we, uh...

307
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,449
I think we hit it off pretty well.

308
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,036
At least that's what she said
in the press junkets.

309
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,163
I wouldn't know.

310
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:18,251
What does that mean?
Figure it out by yourself.

311
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,835
I'll tell you what it means.

312
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,004
She gets motivated,
she goes into the, uh, lab,

313
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,465
and she starts figuring it out.

314
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:25,925
That's real blood.

315
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:29,679
That was, uh, blood
that I took from my, um...

316
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,932
from my big toe.

317
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:37,395
She's trying to do that thing
where you have that little thumb trick,

318
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,272
but she was doing it wrong just then.

319
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:43,109
It looks like you've, like,
taken half your thumb and moved it off.

320
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,070
There's nothing in that cup.

321
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:48,155
Uh-oh, I'm ruining the illusion.

322
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,783
Um, there was probably nothing
on that screen either

323
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,285
when she was looking at it.

324
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:55,121
So, the Viking myths.
She's called by a sound.

325
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,831
The sound of Mjolnir, the hammer.

326
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:02,044
Here she comes. She's opening the book.
Then she gets the idea. That's right.

327
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:04,755
- ["Paradise City" playing]
- Oh, another needle drop!

328
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,176
So if you get Mjolnir, you'll get great
stamina and spirit and great health.

329
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,762
Whoa, could this be a cure?
Maybe it could.

330
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,306
[Waititi vocalises to "Paradise City"]

331
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,351
Now we go to New Asgard.

332
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:19,854
[continues vocalising]

333
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:23,357
<i>Look at this</i>
<i>It's turned into a tourist destination</i>

334
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:24,442
<i>A tourist destination</i>

335
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,861
<i>Now New Asgard</i>
<i>Is a tourist destination</i>

336
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:30,364
Did you see the alien on the rock there?
Very important that you saw that.

337
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,824
Maybe not obvious enough.

338
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,618
Um...

339
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:36,787
Look at this. I wonder if we got
any Old Spice money.

340
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:40,082
We just thought it was funny
that she was advertising Old Spice.

341
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,292
Uh...

342
00:18:45,463 --> 00:18:47,673
I put a lot of work
into that little Old Spice ad.

343
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,843
Infinity Conez is a real thing, guys.
I think it's gonna be at Disneyland.

344
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:52,928
Infinity Conez.
I came up with that idea.

345
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,519
So this here... look at this...
this is, um,

346
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,146
how... how I imagine things would go

347
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:06,192
if you were a New Asgardian refugee
on Earth.

348
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,943
You just... You use what you've got,

349
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:13,658
and what you've got is the resting place
of the famous broken hammer, Mjolnir.

350
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:19,163
And you've got the incredible
New Asgardian theatre troupe,

351
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,500
the Asgardian Players.

352
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,462
Luke Hemsworth,
that's, um, Chris's brother.

353
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:29,256
Better looking.

354
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,758
Uh, better actor.

355
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,930
Then you've also got Matt Damon
from the hit movie...

356
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:40,434
Uh, what was he in? Matt Damon.

357
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,770
The...

358
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,313
<i>Good Will Hunting.</i>

359
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:48,984
And Sam Neill from <i>Event Horizon.</i> Uh...

360
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:53,531
And also,
he also played Damien in <i>Omen III</i>.

361
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:56,575
He played the grown-up Damien,
the devil.

362
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:01,122
Um, now this here is important.
You think we're just messing around.

363
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,666
Just, like, having fun,
making fun of the last movie,

364
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:06,377
making fun of the characters
and everything.

365
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,461
We are.

366
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:12,007
But also, it's important to know
how gods turn into stardust

367
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,760
and also to remember
what happened to Thor's hammer.

368
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,972
That's the whole point of the
theatre show in this film, all right?

369
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,558
And if you don't get that,

370
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:25,354
then you bloody need to go back
to audience school.

371
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:27,565
Melissa McCarthy.

372
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:30,484
[actor Hela]... <i>to stake my claim</i>
<i>as the rightful heir to the throne,</i>

373
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,403
<i>and no one will stop me!</i>

374
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:33,446
<i>Join me or die!</i>

375
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,408
[Waititi] She's wonderful.
I've had a lovely dinner at her house.

376
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,079
That's not how I convinced her
to do the thing.

377
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:46,041
All the cameos in this film, basically,

378
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,962
were just, uh, people who happened to be
in Australia at the time

379
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:54,925
and had nothing to do and were willing
to come and work on this film

380
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,011
for, like, a day for, like, no money.

381
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,929
There's Ben Falcone.

382
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,640
That's Melissa's husband
there on the right, holding her hand.

383
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:05,770
<i>You can almost feel the power of
these magnificent and immovable stones.</i>

384
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:09,190
[Waititi] There's Darryl
from the hit little series, uh,

385
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:11,358
about Thor and Darryl, <i>Thor,</i> uh...

386
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:14,653
<i>Team Thor,</i> from, uh...
that we shot just before <i>Ragnarok.</i>

387
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:18,199
If you go on YouTube or one of
those sites and look up <i>Team Thor,</i>

388
00:21:18,282 --> 00:21:20,534
you'll see a whole lot of adventures
with Thor and Darryl

389
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:22,995
when they're flatmates
together in Australia.

390
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,914
Now, who's this little hobbit?

391
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,501
Who's this one there?
Is that Snow White? Is it Red Riding...

392
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,503
No, it's... [chuckles]

393
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:31,962
...Jane Foster.

394
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:34,715
And these are
the broken pieces of Mjolnir.

395
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,094
Mjolnir. The wonderful hammer of Thor.

396
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,263
Now Mjolnir is now coming to life

397
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:44,016
because Mjolnir and Jane
have a connection.

398
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,851
I don't know if you've seen
the other movies, guys,

399
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:47,686
but Jane and Thor

400
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:48,938
used to be boyfriend and girlfriend.

401
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,481
<i>God of Disaster...</i>

402
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,610
[Waititi] I wrote that line,
"God of Disaster." Pretty proud of it.

403
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:56,403
I think I wrote it.

404
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:01,325
Look, there's Korg, your favourite.

405
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:02,827
What is he wearing?

406
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,912
Not him. What's Korg wearing?

407
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:12,002
You'd think that we just pulled
some of these ideas out of a hat,

408
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:16,632
but no, these giant goats
are actually from the Norse mythology,

409
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:21,762
and they've got real classy names
like Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder.

410
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,476
And they are also in the comic books.

411
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,313
So, at this point, who ripped off who?

412
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,065
[goats screaming]

413
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:34,358
<i>No backsies.</i>

414
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,610
[Waititi] Screechy, screechy goats.

415
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,321
[screaming continues]

416
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:41,991
Cool little scene here
with the Guardians of the Galaxy

417
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,660
coming up in three, two, one, boom!

418
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:47,246
Well, my timing was off.
Maybe I haven't seen this film enough.

419
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,164
[Thor] <i>Retrace your steps.</i>
<i>Where did you put the remote?</i>

420
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:51,834
<i>- One of your goats probably ate it!
- Goats didn't eat the remote.</i>

421
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,086
[Waititi]
Look at that little CGI raccoon!

422
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:56,714
That's, um, Benjamin...

423
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,091
Um...

424
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,927
What's his name? No, what's his name?
Bradley Cooper.

425
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,096
Benjamin? What the hell?

426
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:08,017
Um, listen, guys. I don't know people.

427
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,561
I don't know people's names.
I just know their faces.

428
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:13,188
<i>The goats are gonna be fine.
If not, we can just use them for meat...</i>

429
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:14,857
[screaming stops]

430
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,025
<i>...ting people.</i>

431
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,277
[Waititi] " ...ting people.
Meeting people."

432
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,987
Another one of my classic lines, guys.

433
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,323
<i>...special whistle that goes</i>
<i>something like this.</i> [whistles]

434
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:24,325
<i>No, that's not it.</i> [whistles]
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

435
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:26,160
[Waititi whistles]
"No, that's not it. No, that's not it."

436
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:28,495
Shall I just do all the lines
with the movie

437
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:32,082
as opposed to just
telling you guys fun facts

438
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,169
about how nothing was real on the day

439
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:38,589
and that everything was CGI,
including that wooden thing?

440
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,507
<i>What did we tell you
about jumpin' into new relationships?</i>

441
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:41,592
<i>That I shouldn't be doing that.</i>

442
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:44,136
<i>Yeah, you can't get married
on every single planet we land on.</i>

443
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:45,763
<i>I am Groot.</i>

444
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,973
[Waititi] Uh-oh. Here we go.
Distress calls.

445
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,350
We're about to bring back...

446
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:54,063
We're about to bring back, everybody,
a classic Thorcharacter.

447
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,815
Character from the Thor mythology

448
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:01,111
and also the comic books
and also the first two films.

449
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:04,782
In three, two, one...

450
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,408
two, one...

451
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:09,578
One, two... One... There she is. Sif.

452
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:13,290
The wonderful Lady Sif,
as part of the Guardians...

453
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:15,626
No, what did they call it?
The Warrior... [chuckles]

454
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,337
<i>My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.</i>

455
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,297
[Waititi] The Warriors Three.

456
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,926
The Warriors Three.

457
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:29,682
Aw, now we get it. We get it.
Thor doesn't want to be alone.

458
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:32,935
He feels like everyone
leaves him all the time.

459
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:35,354
Taking a sip of water.
Relax. Chill out. Watch this.

460
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,106
<i>Alas, it's something I'll never have.</i>

461
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:40,025
- [Waititi smacks lips, exhales]
- [glasses clinking]

462
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:44,446
<i>After thousands of years of living, you
don't seem to know who the hell you are.</i>

463
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:48,993
<i>I've been lost before.
But then I found meaning, I found love.</i>

464
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:52,913
Just taking a moment here to reflect
on this moment between these two guys.

465
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:54,790
This is kind of like a break-up scene.

466
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,837
Two star-crossed brothers.

467
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,131
Lover brothers.

468
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:05,509
Not like that,
but, you know, they're in love.

469
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:07,886
Some people like to use
the word "bromance" quite a lot.

470
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,681
I don't like that word.
I think it's a cop-out.

471
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:12,433
What if they're just in love?

472
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,144
But it could never be.

473
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,230
Maybe that's a bromance.

474
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,941
[gasps] Oh, my God, he touched him.

475
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:23,444
<i>You must go. I'll find Sif</i>

476
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:26,321
<i>You answer the other calis.
The galaxy needs its Guardians.</i>

477
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,866
<i>- Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...
- Shh. I know it hurts.</i>

478
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:30,743
<i>But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.</i>

479
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,370
<i>To ease the pain, why don't you, uh...</i>

480
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,874
<i>take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?</i>

481
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:38,959
<i>Oh, you're giving me my ship?</i>

482
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,712
[Waititi] Is it interesting...
probably not...

483
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:45,549
that I feel like
when I've got nothing to say,

484
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:47,426
that maybe means the scene's good?

485
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:48,594
<i>- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.</i>

486
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:49,970
<i>Goodbye, old friend.</i>

487
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,681
Here we go.
Now, I have lots of things to say

488
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:54,266
because the scene falls apart now.

489
00:25:54,349 --> 00:26:00,105
Because there we go, Taika,
making people do stupid handshakes.

490
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,859
And I don't know if he was acting there
when he said that.

491
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:07,946
It certainly was not scripted, him
saying, "Certainly dragging this out."

492
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,282
I think he was talking to me.

493
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:11,658
<i>Hurry up!</i>

494
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:12,743
<i>Not her.</i>

495
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,036
<i>Remember what I told you.</i>

496
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:17,039
[Waititi] All right.
Now the movie kicks off.

497
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:19,083
Check this out.

498
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,378
This is something that Chris and Chris
came up with, this little gag.

499
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,468
I'll still take credit for it, though,
'cause I'm the director.

500
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,389
And off they go. And that's it
for the Guardians, I'm afraid, guys.

501
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:38,393
So, uh, if you only tuned in
to watch the Guardians,

502
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:40,020
you are "shoot" out of luck.

503
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:42,439
And, uh, they're out of here. Uh...

504
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:45,692
Don't expect them to come back.
They're not gonna come back.

505
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:49,988
We did originally think maybe there's
gonna be a cavalry scene at the end.

506
00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:52,491
Yeah, like, "They're back in the movie."

507
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,827
But then we thought, "Too predictable.

508
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,246
We don't want to give
the people what they want."

509
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:00,874
Um, so, nope, they're not coming back.
Too bad.

510
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:06,463
Anyway, off the real heroes go.
Now they're on a world called Falligar.

511
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:10,342
Now, the world of Falligar
and this, uh, next, uh, frame here

512
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:11,885
is directly from the comic book.

513
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:14,638
Look at this one. We copied it.
What do you think about that?

514
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:17,266
Guys, I want to introduce you...
introduce you to my d...

515
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,560
my daughters, Matewa...

516
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:20,811
[Matewa] Hello!

517
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:23,021
[Waititi] ...and Te Kainga O'Te Hinekahu.

518
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:24,231
[Te Kainga] Hello.

519
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:27,276
[Waititi] And, um, so these guys are...

520
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,947
If you listened to the <i>Ragnarok,</i> um,
commentary, Matewa was, uh, on that.

521
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,157
She came in a couple of times.

522
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,617
- You won't even remember that, Matewa.
- [Matewa] No.

523
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:40,372
[Waititi] No. Anyway, you...
you actually, um, made it way better.

524
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:43,292
So I'm really happy
that you guys are here. Um...

525
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:45,961
Now, you've seen the film, kids?

526
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:47,045
[Matewa] Yeah.

527
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:50,549
[Waititi] And, uh, what did you think?

528
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:54,094
[Matewa] Uh, I think it was great.

529
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:57,639
[Waititi] Yeah? Anything...
Any criticisms?

530
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,975
- [Matewa] What?
- Any criticisms?

531
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:01,643
Anything you didn't like?

532
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:05,522
[Matewa] Um, I didn't like
that she was missing an arm.

533
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:08,233
[Waititi] Yeah, well, you know,
missing an arm is not a cool thing.

534
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:09,860
[Matewa scoffs]

535
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:12,279
[Waititi] But she does give
the information about the God Butcher.

536
00:28:12,362 --> 00:28:13,363
[Te Kainga] True.

537
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:14,948
[Matewa] True.

538
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:16,074
[Waititi] Asgard is next.

539
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:18,452
Okay, here's the sleepy little town.

540
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:20,537
Now, fun fact.

541
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:25,334
So all the monsters you're about to see
were designed by kids.

542
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,668
Um...

543
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,922
So, when I was writing the script, uh,

544
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:33,717
TK, Te Hinekahu over here,
my oldest daughter, when she...

545
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,011
I think you must have been
about seven years old.

546
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:39,932
Um, I was writing, and, uh,
TK looked over my shoulder and she goes,

547
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:41,975
"What's a... What's a shadow demon?"

548
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,728
I said, "I don't know. I just had to
write down some sort of monster.

549
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:46,438
But I don't even know
what they look like."

550
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:51,026
So she went off and she drew
the very first of the shadow monsters,

551
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,153
and it was like a snaky-looking thing.

552
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:56,615
You'll see it later. It's called Octy.
You'll see it in a scene later on.

553
00:28:56,698 --> 00:29:02,204
And it was a spiky snake-thing with,
like, three eyes and a spiky head

554
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:03,872
and a nasty mouth.

555
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:07,960
And that's where the idea came from.
We thought, "You know what we should do?

556
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:12,214
We should get all of our kids
across the production

557
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:14,091
to design all the monsters."

558
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:17,761
That's why these monsters are so freaky,
is 'cause kids did them.

559
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,972
[Te Kainga] Kids don't know
how to draw monsters.

560
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:22,975
[Waititi laughs]

561
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:24,393
[Waititi] No, the kids, because...

562
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:28,397
because kids' designs are more scary,
I think, than what adults can do.

563
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,606
Look at this thing.

564
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,608
[Matewa] But what about
the Demogorgon?

565
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:33,860
[Waititi] Listen, I'm not here
to talk about <i>Stranger Things.</i>

566
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:35,487
[Matewa scoffs]

567
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,156
[Waititi] The Demogorgon is scary.
Yes, I'll give you that.

568
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:45,622
Oh, look at that. See, that's
a spider-snake with a weird crab head.

569
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:49,293
Look, here comes Valkyrie!
King Valkyrie on... What?

570
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:52,129
We're not going to say Pegasus.
It's got another name called Warsong.

571
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:55,882
Warsong. And then here comes Thor.

572
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:59,136
Right at the s... Right. Perfect timing.

573
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:01,513
[Te Kainga] With his axe.

574
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,557
[Waititi] And his best friend...

575
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,809
- [person] <i>Look, it's Thor!</i>
- [all cheering]

576
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,686
[Waititi] Korg. Oh, my God. It's me.

577
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,479
- Your father, guys.
- [kids laugh]

578
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:12,149
[Matewa] I thought his best friend
was his hammer.

579
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:15,902
[Waititi] Oh, my God. No.
His best friend is me. In real life too.

580
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:17,529
[Te Kainga] I thought it was his axe.

581
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:21,408
[Waititi] Um, some kids there
looking out a window.

582
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:23,493
[grunts]

583
00:30:23,577 --> 00:30:24,411
Loving it.

584
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:29,624
Look at this big, giant thing.
Some kid drew that. What the hell?

585
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:33,086
And then we killed it.

586
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,338
So this is a big part.

587
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,799
This is a big, very big,
exciting part of the film.

588
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,719
Ready? Steady?

589
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:47,517
This is when Thor and Mjolnir,
the hammer, are reunited.

590
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:52,981
[Waititi, kids making whooshing noises]

591
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:56,526
- [Waititi] Make the noise for it.
- [all continue making whooshing noises]

592
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,904
[blowing into bottle]

593
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:00,822
<i>It's me, Thor.</i>

594
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,199
<i>Have you seen my hammer?</i>

595
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:03,784
<i>Mjolnir, here, boy.</i>

596
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:07,287
[Waititi] Both times
that we've did the premieres,

597
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,122
Matewa, you were asleep by now.

598
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:10,207
[Matewa] I know.

599
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,626
[Waititi laughs] Is that because
you found the movie boring?

600
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,002
- [Matewa] Yeah.
- [Waititi laughs]

601
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:16,671
- [Matewa] Oh, a bit.
- [Te Kainga] Oh, my God.

602
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,841
- [Te Kainga] Dad?
- Yeah?

603
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,511
[Te Kainga] There's also, um...
In the fighting scene...

604
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:24,388
- [Matewa] And goodbye.
- [Te Kainga] In the fighting scene

605
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:26,390
with all the other monsters
and the kids...

606
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:28,975
- [Waititi] Speak into this.
- [Te Kainga] Um...

607
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,936
- There's some...
- [Matewa] The exciting part.

608
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,896
- [Waititi] In the what? Say it again.
- [Te Kainga] In the...

609
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:35,565
In the scene, um, when...

610
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,110
when the kids are fighting
with the other monsters,

611
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:39,611
- like, near the end...
- [Waititi] Yeah.

612
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:42,948
[Te Kainga]... um, I saw
a bigger version of, um, Octy.

613
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,075
- [Waititi] You did? Yeah, we reused him.
- [Te Kainga] Yeah.

614
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,910
[Waititi] Um...

615
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:50,539
Okay, so look, so this is something
that Mjolnir was never able to do,

616
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,833
but I thought, "Here's a great idea.

617
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:57,129
Let's make the hammer even cooler
when it's in, um...

618
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,506
when it's in, uh, Mighty Thor's hands."

619
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:00,924
[Matewa] Yep.

620
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:05,804
[Waititi] The competition begins.
Look, he's now changed his look.

621
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,141
[grunting]

622
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:10,350
<i>Enough tomfoolery.</i>

623
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,686
<i>Why don't you take off that mask
and reveal yourself?</i>

624
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:13,770
<i>Come on.</i>

625
00:32:14,354 --> 00:32:17,274
[Waititi] And, bingo,
it's his ex-girlfriend, Jane.

626
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:18,275
<i>Jane?</i>

627
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:19,943
- [Te Kainga] Boom.
- [Waititi] Boom.

628
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:22,571
[Matewa] That's the whole thing
about this story,

629
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:26,074
that Jane and Thor get to meet.

630
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:27,159
[Waititi] Yes, sir.

631
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:32,998
[Korg] <i>He was a God of Thunder</i>
<i>and she, a woman of science.</i>

632
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,334
[Waititi] Ooh, this is
that little moment. Look at this.

633
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:39,045
- This is the history of Thor and Jane.
- [Matewa] Cute.

634
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,131
- [Te Kainga] Eating pancakes.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

635
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,717
[Matewa] Flapjacks.

636
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,678
- [Waititi chuckles] Flapjacks?
- [Matewa] Flapjacks.

637
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,305
[both laugh]

638
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:49,639
[Waititi] Uh...

639
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:53,185
- Oh. Fun times with them.
- [Te Kainga] Yeah.

640
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:57,397
[Matewa] Yay.

641
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,567
[Waititi] That's my hot dog suit

642
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,444
and that actually belongs
to your Auntie Keisha.

643
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,489
Keisha Castle-Hughes,
from the film <i>Whale Rider</i>

644
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:06,740
- Um...
- [Te Kainga] Oh!

645
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:08,867
- [Waititi] Yeah.
- [Matewa] Hot doggy suit.

646
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,370
[Waititi] The hot dog suit.
She left it at my house after a party.

647
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:13,705
And I've kept it ever since.

648
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:16,791
And now I've put it in the movie
<i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>

649
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,503
Now, this is when he charms the hammer

650
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,672
and he tells the hammer
to look after Jane forever.

651
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:27,636
And that is why... It goes some way
to explaining why she can...

652
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:29,763
[Matewa] Hold the hammer!

653
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,473
[Waititi] Hold the hammer!

654
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,683
[Te Kainga] But doesn't it kill her?

655
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:35,101
[Waititi] Oh, come on, man.

656
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,062
- [Matewa] Stop spoiling.
- [Te Kainga] It's just the facts.

657
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:39,397
[Waititi] Spoiler. What a spoiler.

658
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:40,732
[Te Kainga] Shush.

659
00:33:41,942 --> 00:33:43,985
[Matewa] But does the hammer
actually kill her?

660
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,362
No, the hammer's not killed...

661
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:48,198
The hammer's...
Here's the thing about the hammer, okay.

662
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:49,908
What it's doing is,

663
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:55,205
she's got cancer and when she's
getting the chemo and stuff like that,

664
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:57,707
the hammer is purging her body.

665
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,585
It's taking all the impurities
out of her body,

666
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:03,088
including the chemo.

667
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,424
Which means that the chemo's
having no effect on the cancer.

668
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,759
The cancer's getting worse.

669
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:09,844
So every time she lifts the hammer,
yes, she is a god,

670
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:13,598
but when she goes back to being human,
she's even more sick.

671
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:15,475
Got it?

672
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,227
- [Matewa] Got it.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

673
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,356
This... Oh, God.
We've all been here, haven't we, guys?

674
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:22,524
Argument like this.

675
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,651
- Right, guys? Right, kids?
- [Matewa] Hmm?

676
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:28,238
Remember? When I'm like, "Why don't you
guys clean those two damn plates?"

677
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,489
[Matewa] Sure.

678
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:32,033
- [pop song playing]
- [Korg] <i>Jane wrote a note.</i>

679
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,953
[Waititi] This is, um, a song by ABBA.

680
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:37,289
- You guys know who ABBA is?
- [Te Kainga] No.

681
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:40,000
- [Waititi] Yes, you do.
- [Te Kainga] Uh...

682
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:42,168
[Waititi] Yes, remember?
I played "SOS" quite a lot.

683
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,254
- [Te Kainga] Yeah.
- [Waititi] It's that band.

684
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:47,340
And ABBA... I like to think
that ABBA is Thor's favourite band,

685
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,552
'cause they're a tough Viking band
and Thor's a tough Viking.

686
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:52,304
[Te Kainga] O... Okay. Cool.

687
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,932
<i>It's claustrophobic with the...
the helmet.</i>

688
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:58,018
[grunts]

689
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:01,313
[Matewa] He's not claustrophobic.

690
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:03,481
[Waititi chuckles] But he's acting it.

691
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:06,860
- [Matewa] 'Cause he loves Jane.
- [Waititi] He does love Jane.

692
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:09,487
He's freaked out 'cause
he hasn't seen her for so long.

693
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:10,572
[Te Kainga] Right.

694
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,325
[Waititi] Who do you think... Kids,
who do you think broke up with who?

695
00:35:13,408 --> 00:35:14,993
Do you think Thor broke up with Jane

696
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,328
or Jane broke up with Thor?

697
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:17,829
[Matewa] Jane broke up with Thor.

698
00:35:17,912 --> 00:35:18,997
[Waititi] Yeah, same.

699
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:21,625
[Matewa] Thor's just innocent.

700
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,085
- [Waititi] Innocent?
- [Te Kainga scoffs] Innocent?

701
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:25,670
[Waititi] Yeah, what does that mean?
Dumb?

702
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:27,213
- [Te Kainga laughs]
- [Matewa] No.

703
00:35:28,923 --> 00:35:31,801
[Waititi] Uh, I think just Thor,
you know, was not mature enough.

704
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,345
He was older than Jane.

705
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:36,056
He's, like, 1,200 years old, whatever,
1,500 years old.

706
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,724
- [Te Kainga] 1,200.
- [Waititi] And he...

707
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,476
- [Te Kainga] Thinks he is.
- [Waititi exclaims]

708
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,518
[Te Kainga] Geez.

709
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:43,146
- God.
- [Waititi] Scary.

710
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,940
God, he came out of nowhere! Oh, my God.

711
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:48,151
God, it's like watching it
for the first time for me.

712
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:50,445
- [Matewa] Yeah.
- [Te Kainga laughs]

713
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,238
[Waititi] Imagine if this was
my first time

714
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:55,241
- and I... I didn't even watch the movie.
- [Te Kainga chuckles] Oh, my God.

715
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,535
- [Te Kainga chuckles]
- [Waititi] Whoa.

716
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,580
<i>Hey. Is that the Necrosword?</i>

717
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:03,041
<i>That's cool.
I've only ever read about it in stories.</i>

718
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:06,127
<i>Then you know this is going to hurt.</i>

719
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,089
[Waititi] So Christian Bale...
There. That guy there. Christian Bale...

720
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:11,007
I keep telling this story.
Remember, Matewa, on set?

721
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:12,676
[Matewa] He was the first Batman.

722
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:16,596
[Waititi] Well, he wasn't
the very first Batman in history.

723
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,556
- But he was...
- [Te Kainga] Yeah, he wasn't.

724
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,019
[Waititi] You know, some will say, uh...
Not gonna join in the controversy.

725
00:36:23,103 --> 00:36:25,772
But some will say the best Batman.

726
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,649
Um...

727
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,069
Others say Michael Keaton.
Let's not even get into it, okay?

728
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:32,570
You know, look,

729
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,949
I think even just to play the role
of Batman is an achievement enough.

730
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:37,826
[Matewa] Let's just talk about
<i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i> now.

731
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,369
[Waititi] Yeah, thank you. God.

732
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,497
Okay. Ooh, look. It's Jane with...

733
00:36:43,707 --> 00:36:46,084
Tough look on her face.
Ooh, there comes Valkyrie.

734
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,087
- [Te Kainga] Even tougher.
- This might be too much for him.

735
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,506
He's gotta get out of here.
But he's got a plan B.

736
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:53,717
Do you know what the plan B is for Gorr?

737
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:56,636
[Matewa] To...

738
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,723
To... To... To...

739
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:00,807
To take all the kids.

740
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,851
- [Waititi] What?
- [Matewa] To take all the kids?

741
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:04,978
- [Waititi] Correct.
- [Matewa] Yeah. Correct. Yeah.

742
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:06,688
[Waititi] Sorry, just touching
your microphones.

743
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:07,814
Don't worry, it's gonna be cree.

744
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:10,984
But this is part of the real rawness
and the realness of my commentaries.

745
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,068
You know?

746
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,780
Do you think now it's time
for a little bit of a romantic...

747
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,323
[glasses clinking]

748
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,492
- [Te Kainga] No, it's not.
- [Waititi] Wrong time? Okay, cool.

749
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,411
We'll wait. Um...

750
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:24,789
- [people screaming]
- [creatures growling]

751
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:25,874
Oh, God, look there's...

752
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:29,085
How ironic that the... that the monsters
designed by children

753
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:31,087
are now stealing children.

754
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:32,839
Have you ever unpacked that?

755
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,758
- Hmm?
- [Te Kainga] They didn't steal me.

756
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:38,970
[Waititi] No one would steal you.
No one would dare to steal you from me.

757
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:40,305
[Te Kainga] Hmm.

758
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:42,140
[Waititi] They'd get a pencil
in the throat.

759
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:44,642
[kids chuckle]

760
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,853
[Waititi] I'd use them as a... I'd turn...

761
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:49,147
Whoever tried to do that,
I'd turn them into a pencil case.

762
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,690
- [Matewa] Yeah.
- [Te Kainga chuckles]

763
00:37:50,774 --> 00:37:54,652
[Waititi] And without a zip.
Without a... Without an opening.

764
00:37:54,736 --> 00:37:56,905
- Know what I mean?
- [Matewa] No.

765
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,073
[Waititi] I'd turn them into
a pincushion.

766
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:02,452
Instead of pins,
there'd be pencils and pens,

767
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:05,079
- and knives and forks and spoons.
- [kids chuckling]

768
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,916
Eight years they've been...

769
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,044
- They've been separated for eight years.
- [Te Kainga] I thought it was 8 years.

770
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:12,670
[Waititi] He hasn't really
forgotten about her.

771
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:14,172
[Te Kainga clears throat]

772
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:16,382
[Te Kainga beatboxes]

773
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:19,219
[Waititi] Some beatboxing. I think
it's romantic to have some beatboxing.

774
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:21,721
Let's do it, kids.
Okay, three, two, one.

775
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:24,265
- [Waititi, Te Kainga beatboxing]
- [Matewa laughs]

776
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:25,433
[Matewa] Oh, my God.

777
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:30,188
Nope, nope, nope. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

778
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,356
[Waititi rapping] <i>Romance</i>

779
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,608
<i>It's romance between Thorand Thor</i>

780
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:35,944
<i>It's Jane and Thorand Thor</i>

781
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:38,488
<i>And Mighty Thor</i>
<i>And the original Thor</i>

782
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,323
<i>Here we go now into the next scene</i>

783
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:43,326
<i>The next scene is in the town hall</i>

784
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,454
- [Matewa whoops]
- [Waititi] Okay, you guys are...

785
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:49,082
Auntie Shar...
Don't... Watch out for that mike.

786
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:51,751
Auntie Shari is gonna be here soon.
Watch this.

787
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:54,170
- Oh, no, in a second.
- [Te Kainga mock laughs]

788
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,798
[Matewa] You... Oh, no, in a second.

789
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,593
- [Waititi] Oh, there's Matt Damon.
- [Te Kainga] Hello.

790
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,929
- [Waititi] And Luke Hemsworth.
- [Te Kainga] Yeah.

791
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:06,266
[Waititi] Do you know who Matt Damon is?

792
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,268
[Te Kainga] Uh...

793
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,602
[Waititi] We'll delete that.

794
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:14,858
[Matewa] He looks like Loki.

795
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:17,694
- [Te Kainga] Mm-hmm.
- [Waititi] Mmm...

796
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:21,781
Don't tell him that.
Okay. So, check this out.

797
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:22,866
<i>The one that got away.</i>

798
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:24,617
[Thor] <i>The one that got away.</i>

799
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,452
[Matewa] "The one that got away."

800
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,371
[Waititi] "The one that got away."

801
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:32,083
"The one that got away." Is it?
Does it sound like Korg?

802
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,877
"The one that got away."

803
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,628
[Matewa chuckles]

804
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:37,213
[Te Kainga] He's trying to get it back.

805
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,007
[Waititi] He's trying to get
the hammer back.

806
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,844
Now we've created
this lovely moment in this film,

807
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:44,345
which I think is fantastic,

808
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:47,974
which is, um,
the little jealousy triangle between...

809
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,768
Stormbreaker...

810
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,397
between Stormbreaker
and Mjolnir and Thor.

811
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,733
- [Te Kainga sighs]
- Stormbreaker's jealous of the old...

812
00:39:56,816 --> 00:39:58,943
Don't sigh like that.
It's not that boring.

813
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:01,571
Here we go. Do you see that?
Look, there's Shari.

814
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:03,740
- Do you see her?
- [kids] No.

815
00:40:03,823 --> 00:40:05,658
- [Waititi] Aw, we just missed her.
- [Te Kainga groans]

816
00:40:05,742 --> 00:40:07,994
[Waititi] She was the one yelling.
That's your auntie.

817
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:09,746
[Te Kainga] Oh, yeah. Then I saw that.

818
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:13,333
- [Waititi] Uh-oh.
- [Matewa] Starting a fight.

819
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:21,424
[Waititi] Would you believe
all of this was shot in Australia?

820
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:23,635
[Te Kainga] No.

821
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:25,261
- [Waititi] I know.
- [Te Kainga chuckles]

822
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:28,932
<i>I see what's happening here.</i>

823
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,058
<i>You're afraid.</i>

824
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,267
[Waititi] I would maybe believe it

825
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,144
because all the kids have got
Australian accents.

826
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:34,437
[Te Kainga] True.

827
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,647
<i>Afraid.</i>

828
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,940
<i>Anxious.</i>

829
00:40:37,023 --> 00:40:38,608
[marker squeaking]

830
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:43,029
<i>If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.</i>

831
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:46,574
<i>I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard
to give a rousing speech with the...</i>

832
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:48,368
[Waititi] Okay, guys. Okay, guys. Okay.

833
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,495
See the whiteboard there?
See that? Okay.

834
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,580
I want to tell you guys something.

835
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:56,167
The entire movie is all laid out
in the pictures on that whiteboard.

836
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,838
Everything that happens in the movie
is on that whiteboard.

837
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:05,843
And that's the information
I wanted to give you.

838
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:08,930
Um, I've never told anyone that.

839
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:10,765
So now you can go and pause it

840
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:13,601
and you can have fun looking through
every single little bit of that,

841
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:15,186
and it shows you what happened.

842
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:18,940
It may even have...
And I'm telling you this from my heart...

843
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:22,151
It may even have some deleted scenes
on that whiteboard too.

844
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:25,822
- [Te Kainga exhales sharply]
- [Waititi] Yep, I know. I know.

845
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:29,659
Crazy.

846
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:31,619
<i>He aiso wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?</i>

847
00:41:31,703 --> 00:41:33,371
[child exhales into mike]

848
00:41:33,454 --> 00:41:35,665
[Waititi] Stop purring into the mike.

849
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:37,458
- [blows on mike]
- [Waititi] Don't.

850
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,294
Just sit back, and if you want
to say something, you lean forward.

851
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:43,006
<i>...but it slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...</i>

852
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:46,384
[Waititi clinking glasses]

853
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:47,802
[Te Kainga] Wrong time again.

854
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:51,014
<i>We're up against a cursed,
shadow-zombie kidnapper.</i>

855
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:52,682
<i>Awesome. When do we leave?</i>

856
00:41:52,765 --> 00:41:54,142
[Astrid] <i>Thor.</i>

857
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:55,727
<i>Can you see me?</i>

858
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,061
<i>Uh, floating head alert.</i>

859
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:58,980
<i>It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.</i>

860
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:00,857
<i>Astrid, are you okay?</i>

861
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,900
<i>I no longer go by the name Astrid.</i>

862
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:04,944
<i>I'm now known as Axl.</i>

863
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,821
[Waititi] Look at him.

864
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,781
He's more than just a head, though.

865
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:10,742
- You're about to meet the rest of him.
- [Te Kainga] Mm-hmm.

866
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:12,535
<i>I intend to honourhis wishes.</i>

867
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:13,703
<i>- Axl.
- Astrid.</i>

868
00:42:13,786 --> 00:42:14,996
<i>- I said Axl.
- Astrid.</i>

869
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,290
<i>- Axl!
- It's asshole. Now listen to him!</i>

870
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,792
[Waititi] Oh. What?

871
00:42:20,293 --> 00:42:22,545
- [Matewa] That was you.
- [Waititi] That was the character.

872
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:25,089
<i>Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.</i>

873
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:28,801
[Waititi] So if you remember the movie
you loved so much, <i>Ragnarok,</i>

874
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:33,306
you'll remember the magic eye is
where Thor got to go back to Asgard

875
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:38,394
and visit, um, Heimdall
using ghost powers... vision ghost.

876
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:41,773
<i>Hey, how's it going, kids?</i>

877
00:42:41,856 --> 00:42:43,649
<i>"How's it going?" Look where we are.</i>

878
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:45,735
<i>We're in a cage made of spikes.</i>

879
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,029
<i>Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.</i>

880
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:49,489
<i>Are you gonna do something?</i>

881
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:51,074
<i>Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.</i>

882
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:52,950
<i>I'm the vision ghost. Look.</i>

883
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,744
[Waititi] Um, another fun fact.

884
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:58,414
Commentaries should just be called
Series of Fun Facts.

885
00:42:58,498 --> 00:42:59,499
Another fun fact.

886
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:02,668
Um, Natalie Portman's kids are in here,
in this scene.

887
00:43:02,752 --> 00:43:04,837
<i>So, if you die,
you'll end up in Valhalla.</i>

888
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:07,298
<i>- Oh, my God. Go away.
- Wait, wait. Listen.</i>

889
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:09,425
- [rumbling]
- [children scream]

890
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,261
<i>Okay. It's all right, children.
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.</i>

891
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:15,389
[Waititi] And also,
another boy called Rex,

892
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:17,016
who's, uh, Christian Bale's child,

893
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,684
was also down in the corner.

894
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,687
Down there in the yellow cape. It's Rex!

895
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:27,068
- [Matewa] He has another child?
- [Waititi] Christian?

896
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:28,986
- Yeah.
- [Waititi] He's got a bunch.

897
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,322
- [Matewa] Oh.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

898
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,577
Look, they're on a... a rock boat,

899
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,539
hurtling towards
the black and white part of space,

900
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:41,290
"the place where colour fears to tread."

901
00:43:41,374 --> 00:43:42,542
<i>I'm gonna get you out of here.</i>

902
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:46,295
<i>- I'm scared. We all are.</i>
- [children crying, whimpering]

903
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:48,714
[children] <i>Thor! Thor! Save us.</i>

904
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:51,926
[Waititi] Now, this is really
just a moment

905
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:54,512
to show that Thor is not equipped
to deal with kids.

906
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:58,057
He's just used to
looking after himself, being alone.

907
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:01,477
Kids freak Thor out.

908
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:05,857
But, hey, we know what happens later on.

909
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,859
- [Matewa] Yeah.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

910
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:09,443
<i>Let's bring the rainbow.</i>

911
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:13,406
<i>"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?</i>

912
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,158
<i>She's only been a Thor for a minute.</i>

913
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,994
<i>I mean, saving lives, she's quite good
at. But the rest of it, she needs work.</i>

914
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,996
<i>- How many catchphrases have there been?
- A lot.</i>

915
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:23,583
<i>Yep. Jumped the gun.</i>

916
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,711
<i>Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the Shadow Realm.</i>

917
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,421
<i>It seems like that's where
he's going to be the most powerful.</i>

918
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:31,132
<i>You're right. We can't just go
marching in there. It could be a trap.</i>

919
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:32,717
[Waititi] Any questions, you guys?

920
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:36,971
- [Te Kainga] No.
- [Waititi] Okay. Um...

921
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:38,389
<i>- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.</i>

922
00:44:38,472 --> 00:44:40,349
<i>- Omnipotence City.</i>
- [Korg] <i>Mmm.</i>

923
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,685
<i>What's Omnipotence City?</i>

924
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,020
[Waititi] What about now?

925
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:46,898
<i>We could pull together
the greatest team ever.</i>

926
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:49,233
<i>We could recruit Ra, Hercules,</i>

927
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:50,610
<i>Tumatauenga.</i>

928
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:54,447
<i>Quetzalcoatl, maybe. And Zeus,
the oldest and wisest of them all.</i>

929
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:58,242
[Matewa] Is there only two swear words
in this movie?

930
00:44:58,326 --> 00:44:59,660
[Waititi] Like what?

931
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:04,790
[Matewa] 'Cause when the girl
who, um, lost an arm said, um...

932
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:08,252
'Cause when the girl
who lost an arm said the S-H-word,

933
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:11,505
and then when you said the A-word.

934
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:14,967
[Waititi] Yeah. Uh, those are
the only two I can think of.

935
00:45:15,051 --> 00:45:16,469
[Matewa] Okay.

936
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:18,054
Cool.

937
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,806
<i>Stormbreaker just needs a conduit.</i>

938
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,225
<i>Anything that can handle space travel.</i>

939
00:45:22,308 --> 00:45:23,643
<i>I love it when she talks shop.</i>

940
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:25,186
<i>It has the power to get us there,</i>

941
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,856
<i>it just needs something to focus that
energy so it's not so unpredictable.</i>

942
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,775
<i>You know, uh, if we had a ship
we could harness it</i>

943
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,568
<i>and use Stormbreaker as a power source.</i>

944
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:34,487
<i>- Oh, like an engine.
- Like an engine.</i>

945
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,696
<i>You need a ship?</i>

946
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,323
<i>I've got a ship.</i>

947
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:39,075
[goats scream]

948
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,079
<i>Get rid of all those seats.</i>

949
00:45:43,162 --> 00:45:45,289
<i>And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.</i>

950
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:46,832
<i>We leave in 15 minutes.</i>

951
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,834
<i>Essentiais only, everyone.</i>

952
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:50,795
<i>That's essential. Mm-hmm.</i>

953
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:52,171
[person] <i>Fifteen minutes to departure!</i>

954
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,466
<i>Well, you moved on quick,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i> [chuckles]

955
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:57,093
<i>You're some piece of work.</i>

956
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:00,930
[Waititi] More jealousy.

957
00:46:01,013 --> 00:46:03,307
<i>- Just catching up with an old friend.
- Yeah.</i>

958
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,017
<i>I've been meaning to apologise.</i>

959
00:46:05,518 --> 00:46:08,562
<i>Sorta acting a little weird before. I
just haven't really been myself lately.</i>

960
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:10,106
<i>You know, kind of</i> ..

961
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:15,111
[Waititi] We built this entire town
in Australia, um, out in the suburbs.

962
00:46:15,194 --> 00:46:18,739
We built
an entire Norwegian fishing village.

963
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:22,076
I mean...

964
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:24,745
I mean, why?

965
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,039
I know why.
'Cause it's a movie, and we needed it.

966
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:30,584
But, God, it's a big effort, isn't it?

967
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:35,381
All of the cobblestones and everything
were all hand... hand-cobbled.

968
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:38,050
What do you say?
Hand-pounded into the ground?

969
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,596
We put a lot of effort in, guys.

970
00:46:43,597 --> 00:46:46,934
It's as much effort
as Chris put into those arms.

971
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:49,103
[Jane] <i>See you later.</i>

972
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:51,314
[person] <i>Five minutes to departure!</i>

973
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:55,318
[Matewa] Oh, no.

974
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:56,944
<i>What?</i>

975
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:58,696
<i>We were just talking.</i>

976
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:05,244
[Waititi] Now we get a bit of backstory
with Jane. Okay, like, what drives her.

977
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:07,288
And, uh...

978
00:47:09,415 --> 00:47:12,585
this is where we understand,
oh, Jane is still sick.

979
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,462
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

980
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:17,048
<i>Even when I'm gone, honey...</i>

981
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:19,383
[Waititi] Her mother told her
when she was a kid,

982
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:22,511
"Keep on fighting, no matter what."

983
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:25,348
So she's kind of doing this
for her mother,

984
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:28,059
- and also, because her mother told her...
- [Matewa] "Elaine Foster."

985
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:29,393
[Waititi] Elaine Foster.

986
00:47:29,477 --> 00:47:31,228
[Elaine] <i>Never stop fighting.</i>

987
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:34,899
[Waititi] So she's like,
"No, I'm gonna keep going.

988
00:47:35,691 --> 00:47:37,526
No matter what."

989
00:47:43,616 --> 00:47:45,409
[Matewa] Is that a bed on the ship?

990
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:50,081
[Waititi] No, this is
a little apartment on, uh... on Earth.

991
00:47:50,664 --> 00:47:54,877
My good friend,
Ondine Seabrook, um, from Sydney,

992
00:47:55,711 --> 00:47:59,090
uh, painted that painting there
behind, uh, Tessa.

993
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:00,216
I've always loved that painting.

994
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:01,550
<i>You're a Viking now.</i>

995
00:48:01,634 --> 00:48:03,844
<i>Means you pretty much
have to die in battle...</i>

996
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:06,430
[Waititi] Do you guys
like that painting?

997
00:48:06,514 --> 00:48:08,974
[Matewa] Sure.
I haven't seen it up close.

998
00:48:09,058 --> 00:48:10,434
[Waititi] Yeah, it's beautiful up close.

999
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:13,521
- [Matewa] But it looks cool from afar.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

1000
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:16,023
<i>I love my people,
but it's all meetings and raven-mail</i>

1001
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:17,817
<i>and meetings
that could've been raven-mail.</i>

1002
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,151
<i>I miss fighting.</i>

1003
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:20,528
<i>I miss my sisters.</i>

1004
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:22,488
<i>Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.</i>

1005
00:48:24,198 --> 00:48:25,991
[Waititi] There's a fun... [coughs]

1006
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:27,076
There's a fun bit.

1007
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:30,121
Do you guys know what this song is
coming up?

1008
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:33,916
<i>A hand grenade?</i>

1009
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:35,543
<i>No. It's a portable speaker.</i>

1010
00:48:36,377 --> 00:48:38,045
["Family Affair" plays]

1011
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:42,633
[Waititi vocalising to "Family Affair"]

1012
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,053
Mary J. Blige.

1013
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:50,474
Okay, here we go, guys.
We're off on our adventure.

1014
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:51,976
Now, this joke coming up

1015
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:54,687
is something I'm very proud
to have put into the film.

1016
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:58,274
Some people with...

1017
00:48:58,357 --> 00:49:01,152
<i>We will return with children.</i>

1018
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:04,864
[Waititi] Closed-minded people didn't
like this joke, but I love this joke.

1019
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:06,198
<i>And then we shall feast!</i>

1020
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:08,033
<i>- Not on the children.</i>
- [crowd murmuring]

1021
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:09,660
<i>We do not do that anymore.</i>

1022
00:49:09,743 --> 00:49:12,705
<i>Those were dark times. Shameful times.</i>

1023
00:49:13,372 --> 00:49:15,916
[Waititi] They used to eat kids, guys.
They used to eat kids.

1024
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,793
Okay, here they go.

1025
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:20,588
- [Matewa] Humans used to eat kids?
- [Waititi] Vikings did.

1026
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,840
Listen, do you know
what the Vikings used to do?

1027
00:49:22,923 --> 00:49:25,301
- [Matewa] What?
- [Waititi] Real bad stuff.

1028
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:27,428
- [Matewa] Like what?
- [Waititi] I don't even want to say.

1029
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:28,888
It's not even for kids' ears.

1030
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:30,347
So, you know,

1031
00:49:30,973 --> 00:49:33,851
let's acknowledge the kind of, uh...

1032
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:38,856
Let's acknowledge, you know, just what
it meant to be a Viking back in the day.

1033
00:49:38,939 --> 00:49:41,317
And to be a Space Viking? Ooh.

1034
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,069
- I mean, I shudder to think.
- [Matewa] That wasn't mean.

1035
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:47,239
[Waititi] Oh, yeah, look at this.
We're in Omnipotence City.

1036
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:51,243
Now, Omnipotence City is
something from the comic books.

1037
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:54,246
A lot of the things
in all of the Marvel movies,

1038
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,956
if you know, you know.

1039
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,628
Um, if you know your stuff,
they all come from the comics.

1040
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:02,963
[Matewa] What did Vikings do to people?

1041
00:50:03,047 --> 00:50:04,256
[Waititi] What did Vikings do to people?

1042
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,091
- Yeah, like kids.
- [Waititi] They used to, like...

1043
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,010
I mean...

1044
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:10,971
they used to ride around on boats,

1045
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:13,557
invading other people's
towns and villages and stuff

1046
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:17,019
- and they used to capture people...
- [Te Kainga] What did they do to kids?

1047
00:50:17,102 --> 00:50:19,813
[Waititi] They used to, probably, like,
make kids work.

1048
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:22,650
- [Te Kainga] Yeah.
- They used to make kids, like...

1049
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:25,653
make kids, like, work all day long.

1050
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:30,115
- [Te Kainga] Mm-hmm. And?
- [Waititi] And, um...

1051
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,534
<i>Oh, that's such a good one.</i>

1052
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:35,120
[Waititi] They might, like,
take away all of their toys.

1053
00:50:36,622 --> 00:50:38,082
[Matewa] That's not mean.

1054
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,043
That's not mean.

1055
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:44,004
[Waititi] Yes, it is.
I don't want people taking my toys away.

1056
00:50:44,547 --> 00:50:47,424
Uh-oh. She's like, "Have you
got a girlfriend?" Uh-oh. What?

1057
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:50,052
<i>Just the work and everything.</i>

1058
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:52,137
<i>Cool. Gonna check this place out.</i>

1059
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:54,515
[Waititi] You guys hungry?

1060
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:57,101
[sighs, chuckles]

1061
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:59,228
[Matewa] Mmm. No, I'm good.

1062
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:00,980
<i>The buildings are cool.</i>

1063
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:03,607
[Waititi] You know who's cool?
Tessa Thompson.

1064
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:04,692
[Te Kainga] Yeah.

1065
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:07,403
<i>Feelings? What, for Jane?</i>

1066
00:51:07,486 --> 00:51:09,405
<i>No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.</i>

1067
00:51:09,488 --> 00:51:13,659
[Waititi] And you know what?
Tessa and Chris together on screen

1068
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:14,952
is a fantastic duo.

1069
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:17,371
They're so...
They're always so good together.

1070
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:20,249
- [Te Kainga] Who?
- [Waititi] These two.

1071
00:51:20,332 --> 00:51:21,458
[Te Kainga] Oh.

1072
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:22,543
Yeah.

1073
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,963
[Waititi] She's got the best laugh.
Look at him.

1074
00:51:26,046 --> 00:51:28,257
He's like,
"Oh, I don't know what to do."

1075
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,551
He's falling back in love with Natalie.

1076
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,679
Okay, here comes
Te Hinekahu's, um, Octy.

1077
00:51:33,762 --> 00:51:38,434
The very first, uh, monster
that was designed for this film.

1078
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:40,853
About to show its face.

1079
00:51:40,936 --> 00:51:43,814
- [Te Kainga] I have a toy called Octy.
- [Waititi] Yeah, I know. You do.

1080
00:51:43,897 --> 00:51:45,774
And guess what kind of animal is that?

1081
00:51:45,858 --> 00:51:47,776
- [Te Kainga] An octopus.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

1082
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,279
An octopus. Yeah.

1083
00:51:50,362 --> 00:51:52,906
<i>With all this talk
about chopping off heads,</i>

1084
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,325
<i>I wanna have a go.</i>

1085
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:56,243
<i>What's this?</i>

1086
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:58,037
<i>Oh.</i>

1087
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,163
[Waititi] "Oh."

1088
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:01,540
Uh, screen saver.

1089
00:52:01,624 --> 00:52:04,126
<i>This is Octy. Hello, Octy.</i>

1090
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:06,378
[Waititi] There we go. Look! Octy.

1091
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:08,839
There he is. So there's the spiky snake.

1092
00:52:10,174 --> 00:52:13,135
Sorry, TK, but your beloved...

1093
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:14,345
[Te Kainga gasps] My creation!

1094
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:15,721
[Waititi] Your creation

1095
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:17,431
- just got beheaded.
- No!

1096
00:52:18,057 --> 00:52:19,058
[Te Kainga] Oh, come on.

1097
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:21,310
<i>All right, all right, all right.
Octy's gone.</i>

1098
00:52:22,394 --> 00:52:23,729
[screaming]

1099
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:27,107
<i>Come on.</i> [shushes]

1100
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:28,317
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1101
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,069
<i>Oh, look at you.</i>

1102
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:34,823
<i>I knew a little girl just like you.</i>

1103
00:52:34,907 --> 00:52:38,410
<i>And she was brave, and she was smart...</i>

1104
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,247
[Waititi] And she was
Chris Hemsworth's daughter.

1105
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:44,875
[Matewa] Called Indi.

1106
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:48,504
[Waititi] Called Indi. India.
India Hemsworth.

1107
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:51,840
<i>...about gods.</i>

1108
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:53,634
<i>They're meant to protect you, right?</i>

1109
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,636
<i>Well, where are they?</i>

1110
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,513
[Waititi] There's some good acting
by that girl.

1111
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:02,559
Look at that werewolf kid behind him.
That lycan kid.

1112
00:53:02,643 --> 00:53:04,103
- Look at him!
- [Te Kainga] I know.

1113
00:53:06,939 --> 00:53:08,357
[Waititi] I just...

1114
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,485
just thought it would be a cool idea
to put a werewolf kid in there.

1115
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,737
[Matewa] It's cool. It's cool.

1116
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:18,242
[Waititi] Okay, so now we're in
the t-t-t... golden temple of the gods.

1117
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,326
And...

1118
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:24,998
this is where we see all of the gods
of the universe all gathered.

1119
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:30,129
And this is where... where Thor is trying
to gather an army of gods

1120
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:32,715
to go and fight the God Butcher.

1121
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:33,966
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1122
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:36,552
[Matewa] And this is
where we see a Maori person.

1123
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,887
[Waititi] This is where
we see a Maori god.

1124
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,848
A Maori wahine.

1125
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,267
Atua.

1126
00:53:43,892 --> 00:53:45,394
- Um...
- [Matewa] What god is that?

1127
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:48,480
[Waititi] There's... Atua is...
I didn't want a name to her because...

1128
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:51,024
Okay, let's look quickly at these gods.
Okay.

1129
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:53,068
[Matewa] Ooh, snake.

1130
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:56,238
[Waititi] Good magic.
Look at the eyeball!

1131
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,115
I feel like that's the god of voyeurism.

1132
00:53:58,198 --> 00:54:00,200
She said "god of carpentry,"

1133
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:02,494
which I was...
'cause I suggested it was Jesus.

1134
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:04,997
- [Matewa] What's that god?
- Look at Bao. I came up with that idea.

1135
00:54:05,706 --> 00:54:07,040
I've got so many good ideas.

1136
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:09,752
I came up with the...
the idea for a god that's a dumpling.

1137
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:10,961
There's Ninny of the Nonny.

1138
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:12,963
Did you notice that his throne
is made of scissors?

1139
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:14,673
- [Te Kainga] Yes.
- Those are all scissors he's conquered,

1140
00:54:14,757 --> 00:54:17,134
because in the game
of Rock Paper Scissors,

1141
00:54:17,217 --> 00:54:19,344
rocks destroy scissors,

1142
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:23,098
and those are the ones that he's beaten.
And that's the end of that story.

1143
00:54:23,182 --> 00:54:24,600
[Te Kainga] I wonder if
paper's beaten him.

1144
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:25,809
[Waititi] Do you think that

1145
00:54:25,893 --> 00:54:28,103
the god of scissors
has got a throne made of paper?

1146
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:29,313
[Te Kainga] Mmm.

1147
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:32,232
[Matewa] The god of Ninny Nonny,
is he, um... is he your god?

1148
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:33,901
- [Waititi] Yeah.
- [Matewa] Oh!

1149
00:54:33,984 --> 00:54:36,195
- Cool.
- [Waititi] Yeah. Yeah.

1150
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:37,279
[Te Kainga] Wow.

1151
00:54:37,362 --> 00:54:39,239
[Matewa] Well, then
I like that god the most.

1152
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:40,783
[Waititi] Aw, cool.

1153
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:43,869
- [Te Kainga] Zeus!
- [Waititi] I also love this god.

1154
00:54:43,952 --> 00:54:45,037
[Matewa] Zeus!

1155
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:48,123
- [Waititi] Look, you know who it is?
- [Te Kainga] Yes, it's Russell.

1156
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:49,208
[Waititi] It's Russell.

1157
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:51,084
We went and stayed
on Russell's farm, didn't we?

1158
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:52,169
[Te Kainga] Yeah.

1159
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:55,255
[Waititi] We played with his dogs
and we went on his... the quad bikes.

1160
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:59,301
- And he's got an awesome pool.
- [Te Kainga] Yeah.

1161
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:02,179
[Waititi] And a games room.
That was cool.

1162
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:04,807
[Matewa] Because that pool,
you could jump off the waterfall.

1163
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,891
[Waititi] What's that?

1164
00:55:05,974 --> 00:55:08,060
[Matewa] 'Cause that pool,
you could jump off the waterfall.

1165
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:09,144
[Waititi] Yes, that's right.

1166
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:11,230
But we're not here
to talk about Russell's cool farm.

1167
00:55:11,313 --> 00:55:13,482
We're here to talk about
<i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>

1168
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:15,984
So this is...

1169
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:19,446
So Zeus and Hercules and all of those,
you know, those Greek gods,

1170
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,657
they are actually characters again.

1171
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,992
And not only in real... real mythology,

1172
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:27,412
but, um, also in the Marvel universe.

1173
00:55:27,496 --> 00:55:29,122
Marvel comic universe.

1174
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,708
And, uh,

1175
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:34,711
it was really cool to be able
to introduce Zeus to everyone

1176
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:37,047
in the form of Russell Crowe,

1177
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,174
who is one of my favourite actors
of all time.

1178
00:55:39,258 --> 00:55:43,512
And, um, also, I now like to
count him as a friend of mine.

1179
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:45,138
That was the, uh, Maori god there,

1180
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:49,810
when she's clapping, um,
with her, uh, ponum... pat...

1181
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:52,020
- And...
- [Te Kainga] Her feather in her head.

1182
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:53,605
[Waititi] The feather in her head.

1183
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:56,316
[playing gentle music]

1184
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,402
<i>I hereby open...</i>

1185
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:02,531
<i>this holy council of the god.</i>

1186
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:09,538
[Waititi] So, fun fact. Um...

1187
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:11,999
So, Russell did, um, all of the takes

1188
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:14,710
in a Greek accent
and also in a British accent,

1189
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:17,963
because we weren't sure which one
would be better, which would be funnier.

1190
00:56:18,046 --> 00:56:20,549
You know,
maybe one needed to be more serious.

1191
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:25,262
And in the end, um, everyone loved
the, uh, Greek accent more.

1192
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:29,016
Um, including me.
I thought it was fantastic.

1193
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:30,434
- [Te Kainga] Same.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

1194
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:31,894
- [Matewa] Papa?
- Yeah?

1195
00:56:31,977 --> 00:56:34,521
[Matewa] Do you really
have to be, um, in a disguise?

1196
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:39,192
Because you're one of the, um...
You're a rock person.

1197
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:42,696
And then the Ninny god...
Ninny Nonny god is there, so...

1198
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:44,907
- [Waititi] Right.
- [Matewa] Do you really have to?

1199
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,701
[Waititi] Well, um, you know...

1200
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:51,413
Logic police over here. No, maybe not.

1201
00:56:51,496 --> 00:56:53,040
<i>- These guys.
- Korg, shut up.</i>

1202
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:54,875
But I'm joining in with those guys.

1203
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:56,877
'Cause, like, you know,
maybe I didn't need to,

1204
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,837
but it's good
'cause I'm part of their team.

1205
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:00,213
- [Matewa] Oh.
- I'm part of their team,

1206
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:03,342
so I should just jump in a disguise too.
Whew.

1207
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:05,135
<i>Hello.</i>

1208
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:08,680
[Waititi] Okay, here comes...

1209
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:12,601
Here comes a moment that, um... [chuckles]

1210
00:57:12,684 --> 00:57:14,436
[Matewa] It is in... inappropriate?

1211
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:17,856
[Waititi] It's, uh... Oh, I think it's
highly appropriate. I think it's fine.

1212
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,568
- [Te Kainga] It's just funny.
- [Waititi] It's just a butt. But, uh...

1213
00:57:21,652 --> 00:57:23,195
[Te Kainga] You're spoiling.

1214
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:25,197
[Waititi] Well, yeah.
I think everyone's seen the trailer.

1215
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,491
- [Te Kainga] Yeah, true.
- The only thing everyone talks about.

1216
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:29,368
[Thor] <i>Coming through.</i> [grunts]

1217
00:57:29,451 --> 00:57:30,786
<i>Oops. Sorry.</i>

1218
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:31,912
[Korg] <i>Good luck, bro.</i>

1219
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:34,289
[Matewa] Was that a god too?

1220
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:35,916
[Waititi] Yeah, they're all gods.

1221
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,043
[Matewa] Okay,
then he stepped over a god.

1222
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:41,088
<i>MightyZeus!</i>

1223
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,756
[chuckles] <i>Wow!</i>

1224
00:57:43,465 --> 00:57:44,925
<i>Gods of the universe,</i>

1225
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:48,679
<i>I come here to ask foryourhelp,
to raise an army.</i>

1226
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:52,099
<i>There's a maniac called the God Butcher
who seeks to end us all.</i>

1227
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:53,642
<i>His destruction is everywhere.</i>

1228
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:55,811
<i>Entire planets, realms...</i>

1229
00:57:55,894 --> 00:57:57,813
<i>have been left completely unprotected.</i>

1230
00:57:57,896 --> 00:57:59,731
<i>He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.</i>

1231
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:01,817
<i>But I know where he is,</i>

1232
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:06,363
<i>and with yourhelp we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.</i>

1233
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:07,823
[Zeus] <i>That guy...</i>

1234
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,034
[Waititi imitating Zeus] "That guy."

1235
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:12,202
<i>Boo-hoo.</i>

1236
00:58:12,285 --> 00:58:13,829
<i>If that's all,</i>

1237
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:14,997
<i>pretty boy,</i>

1238
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,915
<i>you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.</i>

1239
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:20,127
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not
hear any of what I just said?</i>

1240
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,212
<i>He's... He's murdering en masse.</i>

1241
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:26,508
[Waititi] Also Russell's real hair here.

1242
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:28,343
Here, his real hair.

1243
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:29,720
His real hair.

1244
00:58:29,803 --> 00:58:32,055
- [Matewa] His real hair?
- [Waititi] And his real beard.

1245
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:34,016
<i>You cannot come to the orgy!</i>

1246
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:36,101
<i>- You have to listen to us!</i>
- [Zeus] <i>That's it!</i>

1247
00:58:36,184 --> 00:58:37,644
<i>Shackle!</i>

1248
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,399
- [Waititi] Uh-oh.
- [Te Kainga] Uh-oh.

1249
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:43,567
[Matewa] Here it comes.

1250
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,777
<i>- What is the signal? Mmm.
- It'll be, "Go. "</i>

1251
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:50,866
[Zeus] <i>Let's see who you are.</i>

1252
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:52,617
<i>I take off your disguise.</i>

1253
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:53,744
<i>And fiick!</i>

1254
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:54,870
[Matewa] Oh, God.

1255
00:58:54,953 --> 00:58:56,955
[crowd gasps]

1256
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:58,040
[Waititi] Uh-oh.

1257
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:01,710
[crowd exclaims]

1258
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,712
<i>You fiicked too hard, damn it!</i>

1259
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:09,885
[Waititi] There was a tattoo there.
"Rip Loki." "RIP Loki."

1260
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:11,678
Um...

1261
00:59:12,512 --> 00:59:16,141
I originally wanted an "RIP Loki" tattoo
in, uh, <i>Ragnarok,</i>

1262
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:20,604
but I'm glad we waited to make it, uh,
such a feature in this one.

1263
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:24,191
There you go.
Now those disguises are gone.

1264
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,780
<i>You are Thor,</i>

1265
00:59:29,863 --> 00:59:31,490
<i>the God of Thunder.</i>

1266
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:35,452
<i>But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?</i>

1267
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:38,955
[Waititi] Whoa.
Flex-a-flex-a-rooni, old Chris there.

1268
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,501
<i>Zeus, this is bigger than us.
He's taken Asgardian children.</i>

1269
00:59:42,584 --> 00:59:45,921
<i>Who do you think we are? The god police?</i>

1270
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:50,092
<i>Every god watches over
their own peoples.</i>

1271
00:59:50,175 --> 00:59:52,803
<i>Nothing more, nothing less.</i>

1272
00:59:52,886 --> 00:59:54,554
<i>Asgardian problems...</i>

1273
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:58,600
[Waititi] "Are Asgardian problems."

1274
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:00,977
Now this is where we get to the crux,
right, guys?

1275
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:04,940
So we're realising the gods actually
may be not worth saving

1276
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:08,944
because they really are self-centred
and they only care about themselves.

1277
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:13,240
And, um, maybe Thor is one of the very
few gods who actually does care.

1278
01:00:14,366 --> 01:00:16,034
Anyway, that was that rant.

1279
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:17,119
So...

1280
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,081
Russell in a close-up. Nothing better.

1281
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:23,959
<i>Gorr has the Necrosword...</i>

1282
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:26,169
<i>which means he could kill us.</i>

1283
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:28,171
<i>Notgood. Two...</i>

1284
01:00:28,255 --> 01:00:30,966
<i>I know you're trying
to do the right thing.</i>

1285
01:00:31,049 --> 01:00:33,969
[Waititi] How you guys doing
with this bit? Enjoying it?

1286
01:00:34,052 --> 01:00:35,053
[Te Kainga] Mm-hmm.

1287
01:00:35,137 --> 01:00:37,973
[Waititi] Is this the first time
you've seen this bit, Matewa?

1288
01:00:38,056 --> 01:00:41,768
[Matewa] Yeah, I've seen it.

1289
01:00:43,728 --> 01:00:46,857
Well, I might've fell asleep
on this part,

1290
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:52,487
but I've seen it in...
when you were actually making it.

1291
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:54,239
[Waititi] Yes, that's right.
You were there, remember?

1292
01:00:54,322 --> 01:00:56,199
And I told you off
and I put you in the corner.

1293
01:00:56,283 --> 01:00:57,701
- [Matewa] Wait, what?
- [Waititi] Yeah.

1294
01:00:57,784 --> 01:01:00,745
You were making too much noise
and being... misbehaving.

1295
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:04,082
- I've got a photo of it.
- [Matewa chuckles]

1296
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:06,960
[Waititi] Oh, here we go.

1297
01:01:08,003 --> 01:01:09,421
<i>We need your lightning bolt.</i>

1298
01:01:10,005 --> 01:01:12,299
<i>My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.</i>

1299
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:15,886
<i>So, I think to use
somebody's secret weapon like this...</i>

1300
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:18,388
[Waititi clinking glasses]

1301
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:21,266
[Matewa] Can I try?

1302
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:24,853
[crowd cheering]

1303
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:30,650
[crowd gasps]

1304
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:39,284
[crowd exclaims]

1305
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:50,086
<i>No!</i>

1306
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,630
[crowd laughs]

1307
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:55,759
<i>Do not worry.</i>

1308
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:58,136
<i>The God Butcher,</i>

1309
01:01:58,762 --> 01:02:00,805
<i>he will not reach Eternity.</i>

1310
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,182
<i>Eternity?</i>

1311
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:04,976
[Waititi] So now we're coming up
to a nice big fight,

1312
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,855
which, um, has got a bit
of influence, um, behind it

1313
01:02:08,939 --> 01:02:11,608
from the great Kurosawa.

1314
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:16,404
And this is, uh, in terms
of the, uh, blood sprays,

1315
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:20,951
which you can obviously... you'll see
in a lot of, uh, martial arts films,

1316
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:23,078
and, uh... including <i>Kill Bill</i>

1317
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:24,162
Um...

1318
01:02:24,996 --> 01:02:27,415
Oh, important bit of information there,
that she just said.

1319
01:02:27,499 --> 01:02:29,793
Eternity is a...
basically a wishing well.

1320
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,086
It's a... It's a being.

1321
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:33,421
If you reach it you can...
If you're the first to reach it,

1322
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:36,925
you can wish for whatever you want,
and that's what Gorr is trying to do.

1323
01:02:37,008 --> 01:02:38,802
Gorr the God Butcher
wants to get to Eternity

1324
01:02:38,885 --> 01:02:43,890
so he can wish for the death of all gods
and effectively end everything.

1325
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,727
<i>I am afraid I cannot allow that.</i>

1326
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:50,230
<i>This is a secret place</i>

1327
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:51,898
<i>known only to the gods.</i>

1328
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:54,276
<i>You know where we are.</i>

1329
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,779
<i>The God Butcher
could use you to find us.</i>

1330
01:02:58,446 --> 01:02:59,864
<i>This is no good.</i>

1331
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:02,242
<i>So now...</i>

1332
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:04,786
[Waititi] "You have to stay."

1333
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:06,663
Oh, "You must stay."

1334
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:11,918
Oh, here we go. Fighty-fight time.

1335
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:13,920
<i>Yes. Rush his bum.</i>

1336
01:03:14,004 --> 01:03:15,380
<i>Hell, yeah!</i>

1337
01:03:15,463 --> 01:03:16,673
[crowd gasps]

1338
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:21,636
[Waititi] Probably the most important
part of this fight, um...

1339
01:03:23,763 --> 01:03:26,308
as you guys are probably well aware,

1340
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:31,771
is the demise of one of the most
beloved characters in the MCU,

1341
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:34,858
Korg the Rock Man.

1342
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:38,361
Look at this wonderful fighting.
I did a bit of this stuff, guys.

1343
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:40,488
A lot of people think
I didn't do any of this

1344
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:41,656
and I was just the voice,

1345
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,617
but I was there most of the time, um,

1346
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:47,579
in my little mocap suit,
doing the actual actions

1347
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:49,414
and doing little stunty fight bits.

1348
01:03:49,497 --> 01:03:52,709
And, yeah,
I just want you guys to know, yeah,

1349
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,794
I'm just as committed
as the other actors.

1350
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:57,547
Just can't see my beautiful face.
Too distracting.

1351
01:04:00,342 --> 01:04:01,343
Uh-oh.

1352
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:06,723
Goodbye, Korg. Three, two, one. Splat.

1353
01:04:07,265 --> 01:04:08,558
[Matewa] No!

1354
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:12,395
[Waititi] Guys, your father is about to
die on-screen. What do you think?

1355
01:04:12,479 --> 01:04:13,480
[Matewa] What?

1356
01:04:14,105 --> 01:04:17,192
[Te Kainga] I would hate that and cry.

1357
01:04:19,486 --> 01:04:21,654
[Matewa] You... "I'm perishing."

1358
01:04:23,615 --> 01:04:24,824
<i>Zeus!</i>

1359
01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:28,370
<i>You're next, Odinson!</i>

1360
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,207
[Waititi] "I'm perishing!"

1361
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:36,836
Uh-oh. Boo!

1362
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,089
One Australian
killing another Australian.

1363
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:43,968
Russell Crowe, though, um,
can we just all acknowledge, by the way,

1364
01:04:44,052 --> 01:04:47,847
originally is from New Zealand.

1365
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:49,557
- [Matewa] Did he actually...
- He's a New Zealander.

1366
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:51,184
- [Matewa] Did he actu...
- Russell Crowe is a New Zealander.

1367
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:52,310
- [Te Kainga] We know.
- Russell Crowe.

1368
01:04:52,394 --> 01:04:54,145
- [Te Kainga] We know. We know.
- Russell Crowe's a New Zealander.

1369
01:04:54,229 --> 01:04:56,189
- [Matewa] Did he actually fall?
- Russell's a New Zealander.

1370
01:04:56,272 --> 01:04:58,733
- [Matewa] Did he actually...
- He's a Kiwi. He's like me.

1371
01:04:58,817 --> 01:05:01,194
- [Matewa] Did he actually fall, though?
- He didn't fall, no.

1372
01:05:01,277 --> 01:05:03,696
He would be...
actually be dead if he fell.

1373
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,782
<i>- I need you to call the goats.
- I'll do my best.</i>

1374
01:05:06,741 --> 01:05:09,244
[Waititi] Oh, hello!
Korg's still alive, by the way.

1375
01:05:11,913 --> 01:05:13,623
[grunts]

1376
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:14,791
<i>Now you've got my six.</i>

1377
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,584
[Waititi] You want some water?

1378
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:19,587
Want some water?

1379
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:22,048
<i>I can do this, damn it.</i> [whistles]

1380
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:23,425
<i>No, that's not it. No, that's not it.</i>

1381
01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:25,009
[whistles] <i>Nope.</i>

1382
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:27,137
<i>Come on, Korg, purse those lips.</i>

1383
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,680
[breathes deeply]

1384
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:30,723
[Waititi imitates whistle]

1385
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:35,854
And the third Guns N' Roses needle drop
in three, two, one, and...

1386
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:38,314
- [vocalises] Bam. Boom.
- [Te Kainga] Bam.

1387
01:05:38,398 --> 01:05:40,900
["Sweet Child O' Mine" playing]

1388
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:44,988
[Waititi, Te Kainga vocalising
to "Sweet Child O' Mine"]

1389
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:49,033
[Waititi] "Sweet Child O' Mine."

1390
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:51,161
Damn! What a banger this song is!

1391
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:54,706
- Never gets old.
- [Matewa] I like this song.

1392
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:56,124
[Waititi] This song is insane, man.

1393
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,878
Can you imagine those guys?
They were probably... How old were they?

1394
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:04,549
Kids, how old was Guns N' Roses when
they, um... when they made this song?

1395
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:06,426
About 22, 20?

1396
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,344
- [Te Kainga] Maybe.
- [Waititi] Yeah, maybe.

1397
01:06:10,221 --> 01:06:12,515
Man, what did I do when I was 20?
Nothing.

1398
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:15,185
I was a late bloomer.

1399
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:19,272
That's the other thing that I'd like
to impart to you two, my darlings.

1400
01:06:19,731 --> 01:06:20,815
There's no hurry, all right?

1401
01:06:20,899 --> 01:06:22,859
Yeah, sure, you can put out
"Sweet Child O' Mine"

1402
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:25,862
when you're 20 or 21, but then...
you know, then what?

1403
01:06:25,945 --> 01:06:27,780
- Then it's just...
- [Matewa] Wait, what?

1404
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:31,409
[Waititi] Then it's just <i>Lies,</i>
and then <i>Use Your Illusion</i> land <i>ll.</i>

1405
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:36,581
I'm saying, like, you know,

1406
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:38,958
I didn't start making films
till I was 30,

1407
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:40,585
and I'm cool with that, you know.

1408
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:44,047
So, like, 30 years of just waiting
around and trying to figure it out.

1409
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,423
No hurry, okay?

1410
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:48,051
I just don't want you guys to rush
into something thinking like,

1411
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:50,345
"Oh, you know, I've got to, you know...

1412
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:53,056
I've got to have it all sorted out
by the time I'm 20."

1413
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:55,183
You don't have to have it
all sorted out.

1414
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:57,519
You can still be finding yourself.

1415
01:06:58,436 --> 01:07:00,063
[Matewa] I want to be in a movie

1416
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:02,774
when I'm just a kid,
like a kid director.

1417
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:05,568
[Waititi] Like a kid actor or kid
director? You want to be a kid director?

1418
01:07:05,652 --> 01:07:07,570
[Matewa] Kid director and a kid actor.

1419
01:07:07,654 --> 01:07:10,240
- [Waititi] Like me, but a kid?
- [Matewa] Yeah.

1420
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:11,908
[Waititi] Damn.

1421
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:13,409
- Just like...
- [Matewa] Like...

1422
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:15,828
[Waititi] And would you direct
a movie full of kids?

1423
01:07:16,621 --> 01:07:17,622
[Matewa] Huh?

1424
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,249
[Waititi] Would you
direct a movie full of kids?

1425
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:20,792
There's lots of other kids in the movie?

1426
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:25,088
[Matewa] Sure. And it will be
a scary movie like <i>Stranger Things.</i>

1427
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:28,132
[Waititi] Like a scary...
Like a scary <i>Bugsy Malone.</i>

1428
01:07:28,216 --> 01:07:30,009
- [Matewa] Yep.
- [Waititi] Mmm.

1429
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:31,928
What about you?

1430
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:35,848
What about you?

1431
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:38,560
[Te Kainga] What are we talking about?

1432
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:41,229
[Waititi] What do you want to do
later on in life?

1433
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,606
- [Te Kainga] I don't know.
- [Waititi] Yeah. Good answer.

1434
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:47,110
You don't need to know. You're young.
Just enjoy the here and now.

1435
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:50,947
I... Personally...

1436
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:54,450
And I'm saying this on a DVD commentary
which is gonna last forever.

1437
01:07:54,534 --> 01:07:56,661
I don't even know
if you should go to university.

1438
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:02,542
And there you go.
There's the silence I wanted to hear.

1439
01:08:03,418 --> 01:08:05,962
Did it do anything for me? I'm not sure.

1440
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,422
- [Te Kainga] Okay.
- [Matewa] Yeah.

1441
01:08:07,505 --> 01:08:08,381
[Waititi] Okay.

1442
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:13,344
Very important part of the movie
coming up here, a very romantic part.

1443
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:15,930
I don't know if I'm gonna
say anything during this little scene.

1444
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:18,308
- Because what is there to say?
- [Matewa] Then don't say anything.

1445
01:08:18,391 --> 01:08:20,768
[Waititi] I'm just
leading up to that. Um...

1446
01:08:21,519 --> 01:08:24,314
He's making peace with his ex.
Great. We love that.

1447
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:26,983
Um...

1448
01:08:30,653 --> 01:08:32,238
<i>Listen, uh,</i>

1449
01:08:32,322 --> 01:08:33,823
<i>are we good?</i>

1450
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:35,283
<i>Yeah?</i>

1451
01:08:35,366 --> 01:08:39,203
[Waititi] I said "um" as if, like, I had
something important to say, but I don't.

1452
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:41,748
Can I also thank you guys
for helping me out on this?

1453
01:08:41,831 --> 01:08:45,418
'Cause I find these commentary things
quite difficult.

1454
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,837
I always start with a lot of energy
and I've got great stories.

1455
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,756
[Matewa] What are you drawing?

1456
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,799
- [Waititi] When? What?
- [Matewa] What are you drawing?

1457
01:08:51,883 --> 01:08:53,009
- [Waititi] Where, here?
- Yeah.

1458
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,594
[Waititi] On this pad?

1459
01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:57,180
I don't know. Some squiggles.
Cool doodles.

1460
01:08:58,014 --> 01:09:00,516
- [Matewa] Doodling.
- Doodling. Let's start a new page.

1461
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,060
[Te Kainga] Can I do some doodling?

1462
01:09:03,102 --> 01:09:05,480
- [Matewa] Can I do some doodling?
- [Waititi] Sure.

1463
01:09:05,563 --> 01:09:07,398
Here, I'm gonna give you
some page... papers.

1464
01:09:08,775 --> 01:09:11,152
<i>It's quite the view, huh?</i> [chuckles]

1465
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:13,112
<i>Yeah. Beautiful.</i>

1466
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:14,947
- [Waititi groans]
- [paper tears]

1467
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:17,200
Oops. I just ruined the pad.
There you go.

1468
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:18,368
- [Matewa] Wow.
- [Te Kainga] Oh, my God.

1469
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:21,162
- [Waititi] There you go. You got a pen?
- [Te Kainga] You really broke that.

1470
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:22,538
[Waititi] Ah, here we go.

1471
01:09:22,622 --> 01:09:24,749
You can just delete that little bit
about paper out, if you want.

1472
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:27,460
But, um, that's real life, isn't it?

1473
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:30,004
So you'll be deleting life. So, killer.

1474
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:34,801
Now, look at these space dolphins.

1475
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:36,094
[Thor] <i>So beautiful. So rare.</i>

1476
01:09:36,177 --> 01:09:37,428
<i>Very loyal creatures.</i>

1477
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:40,223
<i>They mate for life, in packs of six.</i>

1478
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:42,225
<i>Just love.</i>

1479
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:45,311
[Korg singing] <i>With a hey-ninny-nonny</i>
<i>And a fair-finny-fonny</i>

1480

<i>Oh, brother</i>
<i>Man, you look so hot</i>

<i>L wanna get in your rocks</i>

<i>When we get together</i>
<i>We're gonna get it on</i>

1483
01:09:55,446 --> 01:09:59,951
<i>And we're gonna make some babies</i>

1484
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,871
[Waititi] Listen, I'm very proud
of the representation in this film.

1485
01:10:03,955 --> 01:10:06,416
The LGBTQIA+.

1486
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:10,545
<i>...and they go down to a little lava pool,
and they hold hands over the hot lava...</i>

1487
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:12,964
<i>and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart...</i>

1488
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:16,217
<i>and they find they've created
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.</i>

1489
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,053
[Waititi] I, uh... It's...

1490
01:10:19,137 --> 01:10:23,766
But the storyline behind Korg
and the Kronans, um, being a race of...

1491
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:27,729
a species of ma...
of men, male rock people.

1492
01:10:27,812 --> 01:10:30,523
Um, I don't even know if you'd say men.

1493
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:34,485
But, uh, that they're... that they, um,
all make babies together.

1494
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:36,070
The men make babies together.

1495
01:10:36,154 --> 01:10:38,239
Uh, so they go into a volcano
and they hold hands.

1496
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:42,452
This is a whole story that comes from
the comics, okay? So that's canon. Um...

1497
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:44,537
And that was something
that I thought was so awesome.

1498
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:48,124
And I thought, "Well, then we've got
to acknowledge that in the film."

1499
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:50,418
We've got to show that, like,
it's just normal.

1500
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,587
And so I think, with a lot of
the representation in the film,

1501
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:56,466
I feel very proud that, you know,
we're going some way at least.

1502
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:59,635
I know it's, you know...
it's a big film and, you know,

1503
01:11:00,136 --> 01:11:03,181
only small little parts
of the film deal with it,

1504
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:08,728
but I think it's, you know,
at least great to normalise it.

1505
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:14,817
And that we don't have some big soapbox,
stupid, big monologue.

1506
01:11:15,568 --> 01:11:18,321
That we don't have some big monologue
where someone's, like, saying,

1507
01:11:18,404 --> 01:11:21,824
"It's okay to be different," um,
in front of 400 people.

1508
01:11:21,908 --> 01:11:24,619
You know, those big speeches
that you often have to have in films.

1509
01:11:24,702 --> 01:11:27,955
I like that it's just something
that no one really even discusses.

1510
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:32,668
It's just accepted, and people are gay.

1511
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:35,713
And that's cool.

1512
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:39,675
Um, I do like the idea that, you know,

1513
01:11:39,759 --> 01:11:42,136
that young people who are, um...

1514
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:44,806
who are questioning...

1515
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:49,227
questioning themselves,
who are trying to figure it out,

1516
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:52,313
can watch a film like this and go,
"Oh, hey, I'm not alone."

1517
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:57,360
It's actually normal in this world
of comic book superheroes.

1518
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:59,070
<i>- Wait. What's happening?
- Bye.</i>

1519
01:12:00,488 --> 01:12:02,365
[Waititi] Okay, intense moment here.

1520
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:06,369
<i>What did I say? I didn't mean that.
Just kidding.</i>

1521
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:08,079
<i>I don't have cancer.</i>

1522
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:09,664
<i>Let's go smash something.</i>

1523
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:11,457
<i>Jane, I'm so sorry.</i>

1524
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:13,501
<i>Don't be sorry for me.</i>

1525
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:16,587
<i>When did you find out?</i>

1526
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:20,675
<i>Um, like six months ago. I...</i>

1527
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:24,637
<i>I was just feeling tired,
and then they told me I have Stage Four.</i>

1528
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,430
<i>Get my affairs in order.</i>

1529
01:12:27,265 --> 01:12:29,684
<i>And then I heard Mjolnir calling me</i>

1530
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:32,937
<i>so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working</i>

1531
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:35,481
<i>maybe Viking space magic.</i>

1532
01:12:35,565 --> 01:12:37,942
[Waititi] It's not that I don't have
anything to say right now, everyone.

1533
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:40,778
It's just that, uh, I don't need
to say anything.

1534
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:42,572
I've talked quite a lot.

1535
01:12:42,655 --> 01:12:45,241
Let's just sit
and just watch this moment, then I'll...

1536
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,910
I'll start piping up again in a minute.

1537
01:12:47,994 --> 01:12:50,288
<i>Jane, none of us know how long we have.</i>

1538
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:52,707
<i>We don't know what tomorrow holds.</i>

1539
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,083
<i>And Mjolnir...</i>

1540
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,501
<i>Mjolnir chose you.</i>

1541
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:58,462
<i>And it chose you because you're worthy.</i>

1542
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:00,006
<i>And that's something.</i>

1543
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,757
<i>When I first met you,</i>

1544
01:13:01,841 --> 01:13:04,218
<i>I was unworthy.
I was unable to pick up that hammer.</i>

1545
01:13:05,094 --> 01:13:06,470
<i>But you taught me</i>

1546
01:13:06,554 --> 01:13:09,390
<i>there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.</i>

1547
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:12,226
<i>You made me worthy.</i>

1548
01:13:13,686 --> 01:13:15,855
<i>So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.</i>

1549
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:19,108
<i>Okay.</i>

1550
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,568
<i>Now what do you wanna do?</i>

1551
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:24,822
<i>I wanna get those children
back to their families.</i>

1552
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:26,240
<i>I wanna finish that mission.</i>

1553
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:28,784
<i>Spoken like a true Thor.</i>

1554
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:31,996
<i>How do you feel now?</i>

1555
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:34,248
<i>So scared.</i>

1556
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,876
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

1557
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,002
<i>Shitty.</i>

1558
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:39,045
<i>How shitty?</i>

1559
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:40,755
<i>- Really shitty.
- Well, then...</i>

1560
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:46,093
[Matewa] Ugh.

1561
01:13:46,177 --> 01:13:48,304
[Waititi laughing]

1562
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:53,976
Oh, that was the response
I was hoping for.

1563
01:13:54,769 --> 01:13:57,021
Oh, my gosh. That was great.

1564
01:13:57,772 --> 01:13:59,106
[Matewa] Ew. That was "ew."

1565
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,609
[Waititi] That was not "ew."
Kissing's good.

1566
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:05,112
[Matewa] Kissing's... ew.

1567
01:14:05,196 --> 01:14:07,448
[Waititi] Ew? What do you mean "ew"?

1568
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,158
What's wrong with kissing?

1569
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:12,495
- [Matewa] It's disgusting.
- [Waititi] Not disgusting.

1570
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,455
What do you think about kissing?

1571
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,165
- [Te Kainga] It's okay.
- [Matewa] I don't like it.

1572
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,753
[Waititi] Okay, look, guys. Here we go.
Look at this moon. The moon, the moon.

1573
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,630
The moon of shame.

1574
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:27,134
All the colour's draining out of them.
It's turning into a Truffaut film.

1575
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:34,976
Guys, can I just take this opportunity
just to tell everyone

1576
01:14:35,059 --> 01:14:39,939
to please turn off
the motion-blurring thing on your TVs?

1577
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,983
Can I just remind everyone,

1578
01:14:42,066 --> 01:14:45,319
if you're watching this on your TV,
which you probably are,

1579
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:48,739
go into settings, turn off
any of that frame-blending thing,

1580
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:50,199
that motion blur thing,

1581
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:54,161
anything that makes everything
look like a cheap soap opera.

1582
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:55,830
Um, okay?

1583
01:14:55,913 --> 01:15:00,126
These... These TVs are too advanced now,
and they're ruining pictures.

1584
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:03,045
[wind howling]

1585
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:06,632
<i>Where are they?</i>

1586
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:11,762
[Waititi] You need to have
a character ask where the kids are,

1587
01:15:11,846 --> 01:15:15,182
so that you are reminded
that they're looking for the kids.

1588
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:17,393
[gasps] Romance.

1589
01:15:20,438 --> 01:15:21,856
[Matewa] What do you mean?

1590
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:23,816
[Waititi] What do you mean,
what do I mean?

1591
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,986
- [Waititi clinking glasses]
- [Matewa] What do you mean, "romance"?

1592
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:28,487
[Waititi] Romance.
They were holding hands.

1593
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,991
This is perfect timing for the...
[clinking continues]

1594
01:15:44,295 --> 01:15:45,546
Ooh, listen. Guys, listen.

1595
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:48,340
If you take the water and you sort of,
like, spin it like this,

1596
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:51,510
- and then hit it... Listen.
- [glass clinks, rings]

1597
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:53,095
See that? It's like a vibrato.

1598
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:55,806
[clinking continues]

1599

[Jane] <i>Bifrost is the key?</i>

1600
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:02,855
[clinking continues]

1601
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:06,609
[Waititi] Guys, we're in Abbey Road,
and I can imagine the Beatles

1602
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:09,570
just sitting in here, just doing
this kind of stuff, like going...

1603
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:10,780
[clinks glass]

1604
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:12,823
"Ooh, let's put that in.
Just turn that backwards."

1605
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:15,159
Then that would be
the beginning of a song.

1606
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:16,911
All right, here we go.

1607
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:22,166
First time they're all face-to-face
with Gorr the God Butcher.

1608
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,754
Okay, guys, probably not... Now's...
No wind chimes probably for this bit.

1609
01:16:26,837 --> 01:16:28,672
- [Matewa sighs] Okay.
- [Waititi] Though, let's try it.

1610
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:30,341
Do you think it's going to be...

1611
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:32,426
[Te Kainga] Let's just do
some bad guy ones.

1612
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,386
[Waititi] Some bad guy ones?
Hang on, wait.

1613
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,806
Let's... Listen.
Just, like, small, small...

1614
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,724
[clinking glasses softly]

1615
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:45,481
- [Waititi] No, doesn't work.
- [Te Kainga] Yeah, does not work.

1616
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:48,192
Gorr doesn't like it.

1617
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:52,530
[Waititi] I think go like this. Shh.

1618
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,949
[glass clinking]

1619
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:57,993
[Thor grunting]

1620
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:03,666
<i>We really have to stop
meeting like this.</i>

1621
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:04,875
<i>Call the axe.</i>

1622
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,544
<i>I'll call the axe
when you call the dentist.</i>

1623
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,338
<i>Call the axe.</i>

1624
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,507
<i>Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.</i>

1625
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:14,218
[Waititi] Okay,
so we actually, um, debated

1626
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:16,637
whether or not
Gorr was too scary for kids.

1627
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,140
- Kids, what do you think?
- [Te Kainga] I like him.

1628
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:22,143
- [Waititi] Go... Gorr? This guy?
- [Te Kainga] Mm-hmm.

1629
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,854
- [Matewa] He's not scary.

01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:34,986
- [Matewa] Because she's sick.
- [Waititi] That's right.

1782
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,239
It's like, you know, what would you do?

1783
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:41,243
You know, would you... like, would you
have one more day as a god?

1784
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:47,457
Would you trade that to be able
to, like, help the world

1785
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,838
and to have the power of a god,

1786
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:57,843
or would you not pick up the hammer

1787
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:03,849
and have maybe six months left of life,

1788
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,101
but... but being quite sick?

1789
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,103
[Matewa] I'd choose that.

1790
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:10,439
[Waititi] You'd choose that
instead of being a god?

1791
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,191
- Yeah?
- [Matewa] You're gonna die.

1792
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,527
[Waititi] Gonna die anyway.

1793
01:27:17,988 --> 01:27:21,491
I think the answer kind of goes
back and forth for most people.

1794
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,202
I don't know. I don't think
I can answer that, you know?

1795
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:26,413
I'd love... I would... You know...

1796
01:27:26,496 --> 01:27:28,415
For me, probably, I'd take the, um...

1797
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:33,003
Maybe the second option. Just want
more time with, you know, loved ones.

1798
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:39,426
But, you know, some people, uh...

1799
01:27:39,509 --> 01:27:41,762
Some people
would just choose the one day.

1800
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:46,600
[whispers] As we're about to see.

1801
01:27:52,022 --> 01:27:54,232
<i>Remember that the Gate to Eternity
is at the literal centre</i>

1802
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:55,442
<i>- of the universe.
- Universe. Yes.</i>

1803
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:56,860
<i>If you go past the cluster of comets...</i>

1804
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:59,154
<i>Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.
I'm not gonna get lost.</i>

1805
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:05,744
[Waititi] Now, I've heard a term called
"fridging" in the last couple of years.

1806
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:07,496
Um...

1807
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,457
Is this it? Is this what they mean?

1808
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,627
Um, anyway.

1809
01:28:14,669 --> 01:28:17,380
Anyway, the point of the matter is...
The fact of the matter is...

1810
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:19,716
The point is, Thor is now alone,

1811
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,927
having to go off
because everyone else is injured.

1812
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,263
Uh, some of them
happen to be women, but, um...

1813
01:28:26,056 --> 01:28:27,516
Also, Korg was... He's a man.

1814
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:30,685
And he got... he got hurt
being around Thor too, okay? So...

1815
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:33,730
It's not just... just the chicks.

1816
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:36,358
Oh, look, guys. Guys, guys, guys.
A very special moment.

1817
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:39,736
Matewa, my daughter, is on film
in a couple of seconds.

1818
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:40,862
Here she comes.

1819
01:28:40,946 --> 01:28:43,406
- [Te Kainga] Five.
- [Matewa] Four.

1820
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,700
- [Waititi] Three.
- [Matewa] Two.

1821
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:47,536
- [Matewa] Okay. Maybe not now. No, no.
- [Waititi] One.

1822
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:49,204
- And here.
- [Matewa] Five...

1823
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:50,622
- [Waititi] Now.
- ...four...

1824
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:52,123
- [Waititi] Next shot. Watch this.
- ...three.

1825
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,751
[Waititi] There she is there,
in the yellow and orange hair thing.

1826
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:58,755
Matewa Kiri. Anything to say
about your appearance on film?

1827
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:03,093
- [Matewa] No.
- [Waititi] What?

1828
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:04,636
- [Matewa] No.
- [Waititi] Oh.

1829
01:29:05,303 --> 01:29:06,555
Did you have fun that day?

1830
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:09,599
- [Matewa] Maybe.
- [Waititi] Here's what happened.

1831
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:10,767
Matewa did two takes

1832
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:14,312
and then walked off set and said,
"Okay, I'm done. I want my money."

1833
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:17,691
I said, "You've gotta do it all day."
She said, "All day? There's no way.

1834
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:19,192
The costumes aren't real enough.

1835
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:22,445
There's no monsters
and the breaks are too short."

1836
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:24,906
And I said, "Well,
then you're not gonna get paid."

1837
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,032
And then she said...

1838
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,910
"Ah, it doesn't matter. We're rich."

1839
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:32,205
[Te Kainga] What the hell?

1840
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:35,667
[Waititi] You'll find out soon enough

1841
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:38,628
that money certainly does not
grow on trees.

1842
01:29:39,212 --> 01:29:40,797
[Matewa scoffs, chuckles]

1843
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:42,340
[Waititi] Um...

1844
01:29:45,844 --> 01:29:46,845
Now...

1845
01:29:48,138 --> 01:29:50,140
Also, Christian Bale says he, uh...

1846
01:29:50,223 --> 01:29:52,851
he was quite intimidated
by you, Matewa. You...

1847
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:55,770
You really did, uh...
did not care who he was.

1848
01:29:55,854 --> 01:29:56,897
[screaming]

1849
01:29:59,482 --> 01:30:00,483
I was trying to say,

1850
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:03,236
"But, Matewa, you're gonna
be in a scene with Christian Bale,

1851
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,781
the greatest actor
working in our lifetime."

1852
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:09,910
And you were like,
"I don't know what that means."

1853
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:10,994
<i>Go, kids!</i>

1854
01:30:13,246 --> 01:30:14,456
[grunts]

1855
01:30:20,253 --> 01:30:22,923
<i>Everyone okay? All right, gather round.
Gather round.</i>

1856
01:30:23,006 --> 01:30:26,134
<i>Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.</i>

1857
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:31,765
[Waititi] Uh-oh.
Gorr's not happy about this.

1858
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,774
More monsters. More monsters on the way.

1859
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:44,110
- Who's that?
- [Te Kainga] I don't know.

1860
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,029
- I made her up.
- [Waititi] That's cool.

1861
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:49,199
Oh, there's Matewa again
in the little blue cape.

1862
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:50,450
Oh, you missed it.

1863
01:30:53,411 --> 01:30:55,497
She's wearing a little blue wizard cape.

1864
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:58,166
<i>Well, no time to learn like the present.</i>

1865
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:03,880
[Matewa] I'll be in your next movie,
if you even have a next movie.

1866
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:05,590
[Waititi] What do you mean,
"If I ever have a next movie"?

1867
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:06,675
Of course I will.

1868
01:31:06,758 --> 01:31:09,177
- I'm the toast of the town.
- [Matewa] Then I'll be in that.

1869
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,722
[Waititi] I'm one of the most popular
filmmakers in the world.

1870
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,307
Look, there you are again.

1871
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:16,851
[Matewa] I can see me.

1872
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:18,436
[Waititi] You know what?
They painted me out

1873
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,521
'cause I was actually behind you.

1874
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:20,730
I was behind you in a blue suit.

1875
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:21,815
I was holding you there

1876
01:31:21,898 --> 01:31:23,441
'cause you didn't want to
do it by yourself.

1877
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:25,151
I was there for moral
and physical support.

1878
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:28,238
- And then they painted me out.
- [Matewa] They painted you out.

1879
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:29,906
[Waititi] So it looks like you're there
by yourself,

1880
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:32,951
- leaning on an invisible nothing.

01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:04,691
Um, I love this moment.

1892
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:07,610
This was one of the first moments...
This is the first time we wanted...

1893

gonna use, uh, Guns N' Roses.

1894

with "November Rain,"

1896
01:32:14,492 --> 01:32:18,079
and of all these kids empowered with
their little lightning abilities,

1897
01:32:18,163 --> 01:32:23,376
and, um, this was kind of cool for them
to fight all these yucky monsters.

1898
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:27,380
There's nothing cooler than when

01:34:40,722 --> 01:34:41,931
[grunts]

1931
01:34:42,849 --> 01:34:43,850
[grunts]

1932
01:34:50,481 --> 01:34:52,025
<i>We destroy that sword and he's dead.</i>

1933
01:34:52,108 --> 01:34:54,235
<i>The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.</i>

1934
01:34:55,028 --> 01:34:58,281
[Waititi] Okay. You stop Stormbreaker,
I'll take the bad guy.

1935
01:34:58,364 --> 01:34:59,490
Here we go.

1936
01:35:00,575 --> 01:35:02,452
Oh, kids are still fighting.

1937
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:05,747
<i>Stormbreaker, stop this!</i>

1938
01:35:06,372 --> 01:35:08,082
[Waititi] Okay,
as soon as that rune is complete

1939
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:09,792
with that Stormbreaker light...

1940
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:13,504
that gate's gonna be opened.

1941
01:35:18,718 --> 01:35:20,220
[Waititi] Look how cool
this fighting is.

1942
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,097
I'm not saying fighting's cool,

1943
01:35:23,181 --> 01:35:25,725
but I'm saying that this fighting,
this fighting looks cool

1944
01:35:25,808 --> 01:35:28,561
and that Natalie looks awesome.

1945
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:35,693
Now here's what they call
a bad ass moment.

1946
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:38,738
<i>The name is Mighty Thor.</i>

1947
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:41,616
<i>And secondly...</i>

1948
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:44,327
<i>if you can't say Mighty Thor...</i>

1949
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:48,331
<i>...I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.</i>

1950
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,124
[Matewa] Foster!

1951
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,751
[Waititi] Yeah! You know it, girl!

1952
01:35:52,377 --> 01:35:53,503
<i>And thirdly...</i>

1953
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:57,173
<i>Eat my hammer!</i>

1954
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:03,346
[Matewa]
Normally, people say, "Eat my dust."

1955
01:36:03,888 --> 01:36:05,932
[Waititi chuckles]
Normally, people say, "Eat my dust"?

1956
01:36:06,015 --> 01:36:09,102
Oh, man.
What if she'd said, "Eat my dust"?

1957
01:36:09,978 --> 01:36:12,313
I think you say "eat my dust"
when you're running away.

1958
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:16,484
Or, like, you just, like, disappear
and you leave a little cloud of dust.

1959
01:36:17,443 --> 01:36:20,405
Or you just get a lot of dust
and you put it in a sandwich,

1960
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:23,199
and then they eat it, and you're like,
"Ah, you're eating my dust."

1961
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:28,788
Did you know that dust is made up of,
uh, dead human skin cells?

1962
01:36:28,871 --> 01:36:30,581
- [Matewa] Yeah, I know.
- A lot of it.

1963
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:33,209
So "eat my dust" is just saying,
"Eat me."

1964
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:35,753
[Matewa, Te Kainga chuckling]

1965
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:37,630
Eat my dead skin.

1966
01:36:38,089 --> 01:36:39,132
Bro.

1967
01:36:42,468 --> 01:36:43,928
[Matewa] Want some dead skin, bro?

1968
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:45,847
[Waititi] Hey, bro,
you want some dead skin?

1969
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:49,934
[Te Kainga] Just eat some
of this dead skin. [chuckles]

1970
01:36:50,893 --> 01:36:52,437
Slash dust.

1971
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,646
[Waititi] Okay, here we go.

1972
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:55,064
Very important moment here.

1973
01:36:55,148 --> 01:36:57,483
The Necrosword is about to be destroyed.
They're working together.

1974
01:36:57,567 --> 01:37:01,821
He knows it's her last moment
of being a god.

1975
01:37:01,904 --> 01:37:05,491
And with her last moment,
she's going to save the day.

1976
01:37:07,452 --> 01:37:09,537
Now that's sacrifice.

1977
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,457
[Te Kainga] "Now that's sacrifice."
That's you, Dad.

1978
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,460
- "Now that's sacrifice."
- [Waititi] Oh, I'll sacrifice, bro.

1979
01:37:20,631 --> 01:37:22,091
[Te Kainga trills]

1980
01:37:23,301 --> 01:37:25,595
- [Te Kainga trills]
- [Waititi vocalising soundtrack score]

1981
01:37:28,014 --> 01:37:31,142
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1982
01:37:34,228 --> 01:37:36,439
- [Matewa] So sad.
- [Waititi] Totally.

1983
01:37:38,316 --> 01:37:39,567
[Matewa] Totally.

1984
01:37:44,697 --> 01:37:46,699
- [thunder rumbling]
- [electricity crackling]

1985
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:58,753
[Matewa] Did Thor and Jane
do kissing rehearsals

1986
01:37:58,836 --> 01:38:00,463
before they actually kissed?

1987
01:38:01,255 --> 01:38:02,882
- [Waititi] Thor and Jane?
- [Matewa] Yeah.

1988
01:38:03,508 --> 01:38:06,135
- Or did they just...
- [Waititi] Kissing rehearsals?

1989
01:38:06,219 --> 01:38:07,887
- [Matewa] Yeah, they kiss.
- [Te Kainga] Is that even a thing?

1990
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:11,099
[Waititi] They don't need...
You don't need to do kissing rehearsals.

1991
01:38:14,644 --> 01:38:15,895
[Matewa] Like kissing practise.

1992
01:38:15,978 --> 01:38:17,730
- [Waititi] Yeah. No, you don't.
- [Te Kainga] No.

1993
01:38:17,814 --> 01:38:19,816
[Waititi playing synthesiser]

1994
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:24,904
[Matewa] Dad, now is not the time.

1995
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:30,159
[Waititi] Yes, now is the time
to make it sound like <i>Dune.</i>

1996
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:33,246
[synthesiser continues playing]

1997
01:38:40,169 --> 01:38:41,462
<i>Gorr! Stop!</i>

1998
01:38:43,339 --> 01:38:44,841
[synthesiser continues playing]

1999
01:38:44,924 --> 01:38:46,843
- [Waititi chuckles]
- [Te Kainga] Oh, my God.

2000
01:38:54,392 --> 01:38:56,269
[Matewa] Okay. I want to listen now.

2001
01:38:59,564 --> 01:39:02,442
<i>It's not death or revenge that you seek.</i>

2002
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:05,027
[Waititi imitates synthesiser vibrato]

2003
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:07,530
<i>What do I seek?</i>

2004
01:39:17,206 --> 01:39:19,459
- [synthesiser stops]
- [Waititi] It was just me adding my own...

2005
01:39:21,169 --> 01:39:22,503
<i>You seek love.</i>

2006
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:26,674
<i>Love?</i>

2007
01:39:26,757 --> 01:39:30,052
- [Waititi] Careful. Don't do that.
- [Matewa imitates] Don't do that.

2008
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,721
[Waititi] Okay.

2009
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,641
What do we want?

2010
01:39:35,725 --> 01:39:37,143
Love. When do we want it?

2011
01:39:37,226 --> 01:39:39,145
- Mmm, not sure.
- [Matewa chuckles]

2012
01:39:41,981 --> 01:39:43,399
[Waititi] Important moment coming up.

2013
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:46,777
So this is when Gorr sees really
that Thor's right, because it...

2014
01:39:46,861 --> 01:39:49,697
The whole thing
that's been driving him is what?

2015
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:54,285
We think it's revenge, but it's actually
because he misses his love.

2016
01:39:54,368 --> 01:39:56,913
- [Te Kainga] Daughter.
- [Waititi] The daughter.

2017
01:39:56,996 --> 01:39:58,247
- That's right.
- [Matewa] Indi.

2018
01:39:58,331 --> 01:40:00,208
[Waititi] Indi. Well, you know,
we say that the name...

2019
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,667
[Te Kainga]
Not technically his daughter.

2020
01:40:01,751 --> 01:40:03,419
[Waititi] We say that
the name is "Love."

2021
01:40:03,503 --> 01:40:05,338
[Te Kainga]
And it's not technically his daughter.

2022
01:40:05,421 --> 01:40:06,756
[Waititi] We say her name is Love.

2023
01:40:09,133 --> 01:40:12,345
Should we get a little photo outside
on that little zebra crossing?

2024
01:40:13,596 --> 01:40:16,849
- It was a famous zebra crossing.
- [Te Kainga] But does it really matter?

2025
01:40:19,018 --> 01:40:20,019
[Waititi] Uh...

2026
01:40:20,102 --> 01:40:22,146
Well, it does to me.

2027
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:24,232
- [Matewa] What's a zebra crossing?
- [Waititi] Be a nice thing.

2028
01:40:24,857 --> 01:40:26,984
I'll show you the picture
from the original thing.

2029
01:40:27,068 --> 01:40:28,945
[coughs]

2030
01:40:29,028 --> 01:40:31,364
[Waititi]
Be super original for us to do that.

2031
01:40:31,447 --> 01:40:32,782
[Matewa] Super original.

2032
01:40:32,865 --> 01:40:35,535
[Waititi] So original. Oh, my God.

2033
01:40:35,618 --> 01:40:39,622
So... Oh, my God, we're really
talking over this super emotional scene,

2034
01:40:39,705 --> 01:40:41,457
and that's very disrespectful
to the acting

2035
01:40:41,541 --> 01:40:43,793
and to the emotion and to the drama

2036
01:40:43,876 --> 01:40:49,799
and to the complete character arcs
that we are witnessing right now.

2037
01:40:49,882 --> 01:40:53,970
And we're making noise, and we're making
fun of it by going like, "Oh, my God."

2038
01:40:54,053 --> 01:40:57,139
Um, can you just put that envelope down
for a second?

2039
01:40:57,223 --> 01:40:59,392
[Te Kainga] I'm just gonna do one thing.

2040
01:40:59,475 --> 01:41:00,851
[Waititi] What?

2041
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:03,729
[Te Kainga] Tape this to that.

2042
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:05,731
[exhales]

2043
01:41:05,815 --> 01:41:07,483
[Waititi] Okay, now, can we just
watch the end of this

2044
01:41:07,567 --> 01:41:10,695
and pay some...
pay our respects to Jane Foster,

2045
01:41:10,778 --> 01:41:14,073
and also show some respect
to the fine acting in this film?

2046
01:41:14,865 --> 01:41:16,784
- [Matewa] <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>
- [Waititi] High five.

2047
01:41:16,867 --> 01:41:18,286
[Matewa chuckles]

2048
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:28,421
[Waititi] Um...

2049
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:30,590
And slow and behold, check it out.

2050
01:41:30,673 --> 01:41:36,095
He... He... He actually wishes
for the return of... Who is that?

2051
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:38,222
- [Matewa] Indi.
- [Waititi] Look at that thing.

2052
01:41:38,306 --> 01:41:40,099
The sparkly galaxy girl.

2053
01:41:40,182 --> 01:41:42,893
Because it's a child born of Eternity.

2054
01:41:44,604 --> 01:41:47,106
So Indi's back. Sorry. Love is back.

2055
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:53,446
And he's now been rinsed clean
of the evilness from the sword.

2056
01:41:54,405 --> 01:41:57,074
He's his old self, but he's dying. Sick.

2057
01:41:57,158 --> 01:41:58,659
Such has been his torment,

2058
01:41:58,743 --> 01:42:02,288
and such has been
the trials and tribulations of Gorr.

2059
01:42:08,044 --> 01:42:09,962
<i>I've missed you so much.</i>

2060
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,467
<i>I missed you too.</i>

2061
01:42:16,344 --> 01:42:18,888
[Matewa] And she's so happy
that he's dying.

2062
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:20,723
- [Te Kainga] Oh!
- [Waititi] Whatever.

2063
01:42:21,515 --> 01:42:23,643
- [Te Kainga] No, she's so sad.
- [Waititi] Yeah.

2064
01:42:23,726 --> 01:42:27,229
[Matewa] Look at her! She's smiling.

2065
01:42:28,856 --> 01:42:30,399
<i>I've gotten an extra life.</i>

2066
01:42:30,483 --> 01:42:33,235
[Waititi] You don't know
what people would go...

2067
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:34,737
what your reaction would be

2068
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:36,989
or what your expression would be
in a situation like that.

2069
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:40,868
[Matewa] Actually would.

2070
01:42:40,951 --> 01:42:42,745
[Waititi] Some people smile
out of nervousness.

2071
01:42:42,828 --> 01:42:44,830
It's like they can't control themselves.

2072
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,001
Look, he's smiling. So is she.

2073
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:53,255
You know why? Because they're happy
that they've managed to have love

2074
01:42:53,339 --> 01:42:54,590
for that brief moment again.

2075
01:42:55,466 --> 01:42:57,593
Better to have loved and lost...

2076
01:42:57,677 --> 01:43:00,179
Better to have love for a little while...

2077

uh, thank you so much for listening
and watching and listening.

2151
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:15,184
And I really hope
that you've enjoyed it.

2152
01:47:15,267 --> 01:47:17,269
I'll be amazed
if you've made it this far.

2153

<i>What did you do?</i>

2154
01:47:19,813 --> 01:47:22,650
I'd most like to thank my, uh,
two friends,

2155
01:47:22,733 --> 01:47:28,530
aka, my daughters Te Kainga and Matewa.

2156

Um, thank you so much
for being part of this.

How has it been for you?

2158
01:47:33,619 --> 01:47:35,120
- [Matewa] Good.
- [Waititi] Yeah?

2159
01:47:35,204 --> 01:47:38,874

[Matewa] Mmm...

2164
01:47:46,173 --> 01:47:48,926
I have never seen it.

2165
01:47:49,009 --> 01:47:53,764
And when you, um... And, like,
when you were actually making it,

2166
01:47:53,847 --> 01:48:00,062
I had never seen, um, Korg find Dwayne.

2167
01:48:00,688 --> 01:48:03,315
[Waititi] Yes, but now Korg
has found Dwayne.

2168
01:48:03,399 --> 01:48:04,817
That was happening when you were...

2169
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,235
maybe when you were at school.

2170
01:48:06,819 --> 01:48:10,239
- Um, how was your experience?
- [Te Kainga] It was fun.

2171
01:48:10,322 --> 01:48:12,116
[Waititi] Great. Okay, cool.

2172
01:48:12,199 --> 01:48:13,659
Well, thanks so much for watching.

2173
01:48:13,742 --> 01:48:15,452
This has been <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>

2174
01:48:15,536 --> 01:48:17,538
Um... and...

2175
01:48:18,831 --> 01:48:22,251
I hope you've enjoyed it.
Thank you very much for your support.

2176
01:48:24,169 --> 01:48:27,631
I'd also just like to say,
just through the credits here...

2177
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:30,718

2178

Enjoy the credits.

2181
01:48:42,146 --> 01:48:44,106
There's some little tags.

2182
01:48:44,189 --> 01:48:47,192
Uh, I guess I should talk quickly about
the tag scene. This first tag scene.

2183
01:48:47,276 --> 01:48:48,652
I won't wait till the end of the film,

2184
01:48:48,736 --> 01:48:53,407
but this tag scene here,
coming up in a couple of secs, um...

2185
01:48:54,783 --> 01:48:55,868
Do I need to talk about it?

2186
01:48:55,951 --> 01:48:58,203
Maybe I won't. Just watch it.
It's got that guy from...

2187
01:48:58,287 --> 01:48:59,580
[Matewa] Taika Waititi.

2188
01:48:59,663 --> 01:49:02,041
[Waititi] It's got that guy
from England in it who's...

2189
01:49:02,124 --> 01:49:04,168
This guy Brett Goldstein,
who everyone loves.

2190
01:49:04,251 --> 01:49:09,673
And, um, it promises something
for the future involving Hercules

2191
01:49:09,757 --> 01:49:12,593
and those other characters, um,
Zeus and everything.

2192
01:49:12,676 --> 01:49:15,596
And I'm very, very excited
to think that, uh,

2193
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:19,683
that could be a whole new part
of the MCU, uh, coming up.

2194
01:49:21,268 --> 01:49:22,895
Okay. Take care, everyone.
